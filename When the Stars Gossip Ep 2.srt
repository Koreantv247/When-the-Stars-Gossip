00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,152
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

00:00:01,233 --> 00:00:02,066
<i>Fifteen.</i>

00:00:02,147 --> 00:00:03,287
THE FOLLOWING PROGRAM IS
NOT SUITABLE FOR VIEWERS UNDER 15

00:00:03,368 --> 00:00:04,535
VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED

5
00:00:04,616 --> 00:00:05,822
THIS PROGRAM CONTAINS PRODUCT PLACEMENTS
AND VIRTUAL ADVERTISING

6
00:00:05,903 --> 00:00:07,801
PRODUCTION SPONSORS: MINISTRY OF
CULTURE, SPORTS AND TOURISM, KOCCA

00:00:07,882 --> 00:00:09,076
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS,
ORGANIZATIONS, AND INCIDENTS

8
00:00:09,157 --> 00:00:10,309
DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
ARE ENTIRELY FICTITIOUS

9
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:11,629
CHILD ACTORS WERE FILMED SAFELY
IN THE PRESENCE OF THEIR GUARDIANS,

10
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:12,812
AND SCENES INVOLVING ANIMALS WERE FILMED
WITH ADVICE AND COOPERATION OF EXPERTS

11
00:00:12,893 --> 00:00:16,939
Guess which creatures currently dominate
the population on the space station.

12
00:00:17,523 --> 00:00:20,234
Topping the list are 30,000 fruit flies,

13
00:00:20,318 --> 00:00:23,404
with 80 mice coming in second.

14
00:00:23,487 --> 00:00:27,533
The real owners of the space station,
which can house up to nine astronauts,

15
00:00:27,617 --> 00:00:28,951
may be fruit flies and mice.

16
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:32,496
<i>Since humans and mice
share 85 percent of their genes,</i>

17
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,248
<i>studying mice in zero gravity</i>

18
00:00:34,332 --> 00:00:37,501
<i>provides a glimpse into
how humans might adapt to space.</i>

19
00:00:37,585 --> 00:00:41,505
<i>Most of human gene functions have been
discovered through studies on fruit flies.</i>

20
00:00:41,589 --> 00:00:45,593
<i>As you can see, the reality
of the space station is quite different</i>

21
00:00:45,676 --> 00:00:47,345
<i>from what we might imagine.</i>

22
00:00:47,428 --> 00:00:50,765
<i>Let's hear more from Chief Kang Tae-hui
at the Seoul Mission Control Center.</i>

23
00:00:50,848 --> 00:00:52,808
<i>The space station's
zero-gravity environment</i>

24
00:00:52,892 --> 00:00:56,103
<i>enables experiments that
can't be conducted under Earth's gravity.</i>

25
00:00:56,187 --> 00:00:58,105
The space station's true purpose is

26
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:00,858
to study how
the human cardiovascular, musculoskeletal,

27
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:04,028
neuroendocrine, and immune systems
are affected in space,

28
00:01:04,111 --> 00:01:06,447
using fruit flies and mice for testing.

29
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:09,492
The Expedition 3 team, which recently
embarked on their space mission,

30
00:01:09,575 --> 00:01:12,828
<i>is ready to break new ground once again.</i>

31
00:01:13,454 --> 00:01:17,541
<i>Here's an interview with
Commander Eve Kim of Expedition 3.</i>

32
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:21,796
<i>Our mission is to attempt mating,
pregnancy, and breeding in mice again.</i>

33
00:01:21,879 --> 00:01:23,923
<i>Fruit flies, minnows, and cockroaches</i>

34
00:01:24,006 --> 00:01:27,093
<i>are the only species to have
successfully reproduced in space.</i>

35
00:01:27,176 --> 00:01:28,177
<i>Mice, like us humans…</i>

36
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,679
Sir, they'll be docking soon.

37
00:01:29,762 --> 00:01:31,514
<i>…have never mated,</i>

38
00:01:31,597 --> 00:01:34,558
<i>become pregnant, or given birth in space.</i>

39
00:01:34,642 --> 00:01:35,977
<i>For humans to sustain life</i>

40
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,563
<i>and reproduce in space,
mice must first succeed in breeding.</i>

41
00:01:39,647 --> 00:01:42,149
<i>Now, what's the mission
of the space tourist</i>

42
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:45,027
<i>who paid a whopping 70 billion won
to join them?</i>

43
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,955
<i>G.O-10, approximately 400 meters
until rendezvous.</i>

44
00:01:56,038 --> 00:01:57,039
Copy.

45
00:01:57,123 --> 00:01:58,124
Copy.

46
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,710
<i>Initiating the fly-around.</i>

47
00:02:03,254 --> 00:02:05,131
<i>Onboard navigation is working fine.</i>

48
00:02:05,631 --> 00:02:09,635
<i>Standing by
for contingency manual docking. Over.</i>

49
00:02:10,386 --> 00:02:11,387
<i>Copy that.</i>

50
00:02:45,963 --> 00:02:47,590
<i>Rotation is nominal.</i>

51
00:02:47,673 --> 00:02:49,842
Engine operation, normal.

52
00:02:50,718 --> 00:02:52,553
<i>150 meters to the ILS.</i>

53
00:02:52,636 --> 00:02:55,848
<i>Changing direction from
the Kurs antenna to the docking point.</i>

54
00:02:56,766 --> 00:02:58,809
<i>G.O-10 approaching the ILS.</i>

55
00:02:58,893 --> 00:03:00,352
<i>Stand by for contact.</i>

56
00:03:00,436 --> 00:03:02,396
All right, we're about to dock now.

57
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,231
- Engage your core, sir.
- Okay.

58
00:03:36,138 --> 00:03:37,973
<i>Checking the crosshair alignment.</i>

59
00:03:56,826 --> 00:03:57,827
<i>Contact?</i>

60
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:00,955
<i>Crosshairs are not aligned.</i>

61
00:04:01,038 --> 00:04:02,540
Oh, man.

62
00:04:02,623 --> 00:04:04,041
<i>Stand by for manual docking.</i>

63
00:04:19,223 --> 00:04:20,391
Come on, man.

64
00:04:22,685 --> 00:04:23,519
Contact?

65
00:04:24,937 --> 00:04:26,856
<i>G.O-10 retrying for the alignment.</i>

66
00:04:27,773 --> 00:04:29,191
<i>Five feet.</i>

67
00:04:29,275 --> 00:04:30,484
<i>Three.</i>

68
00:04:30,568 --> 00:04:31,861
<i>Two.</i>

69
00:04:31,944 --> 00:04:32,945
<i>One.</i>

70
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:35,573
<i>Target in the center.</i>

71
00:04:35,656 --> 00:04:37,908
Here we go, G.O-10. Yeah.

72
00:04:37,992 --> 00:04:40,452
Good boy.

73
00:04:52,548 --> 00:04:55,467
<i>This is IOU.
Contact and capture confirmed.</i>

74
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:57,011
Docking…

75
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,680
complete.

76
00:05:04,018 --> 00:05:09,189
<i>Contact and capture confirmed
at 16:20 central time, 17:20 eastern time.</i>

77
00:05:09,273 --> 00:05:12,151
<i>Two vehicles are
flying high above the Pacific Ocean,</i>

78
00:05:12,234 --> 00:05:13,736
<i>just to the west of Peru.</i>

79
00:05:14,695 --> 00:05:16,780
They have finally docked successfully.

80
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:18,616
It's on.

81
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:20,618
It's on! The doping was successful!

82
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:22,369
It's "docking," okay?

83
00:05:22,453 --> 00:05:25,414
Oh, thank God in heaven.

84
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,086
Victory!

85
00:05:33,714 --> 00:05:35,507
<i>Leak test, complete.</i>

86
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,303
Both docking area completely sealed.

87
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:42,431
Perfect!

88
00:05:52,775 --> 00:05:54,068
Nice.

89
00:05:54,151 --> 00:05:56,070
Docking area sealed, okay?

90
00:06:00,908 --> 00:06:03,577
<i>Station IOU and Spaceship G.O-10,</i>

91
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:05,537
<i>you have a go for Step 6.</i>

92
00:06:05,621 --> 00:06:07,081
<i>Ingressing ILS.</i>

93
00:06:11,877 --> 00:06:12,962
Finally, the space station.

94
00:06:14,296 --> 00:06:16,173
Commander, I'm nervous.

95
00:06:19,134 --> 00:06:21,512
I told them several times
to make it longer!

96
00:06:21,595 --> 00:06:23,847
It gets tight in my crotch
in zero gravity.

97
00:06:23,931 --> 00:06:25,140
I grow taller here.

98
00:06:26,475 --> 00:06:29,061
- You haven't knocked yet, have you?
- Not yet.

99
00:06:29,144 --> 00:06:31,647
All right. We'll knock on our side first,

100
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:34,525
and if we hear them knock back,
it means the docking was successful.

101
00:06:35,067 --> 00:06:36,443
Santi, lead the way.

102
00:06:36,527 --> 00:06:37,820
No, you got it.

103
00:06:39,363 --> 00:06:41,240
We don't have all day, Commander.

104
00:06:41,323 --> 00:06:42,658
EVE: COMMANDER OF EXPEDITION 3

105
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:43,575
Okay.

106
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:46,745
When they open the hatch and enter,
it'll be broadcast live worldwide.

107
00:06:46,829 --> 00:06:48,747
Let's make sure not to touch this part.

108
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,915
Okay.

109
00:06:53,085 --> 00:06:55,462
Our voices won't be
broadcast to Earth, right?

110
00:06:57,506 --> 00:06:58,549
Will they?

111
00:07:28,746 --> 00:07:29,621
Ready?

112
00:07:33,876 --> 00:07:35,127
Wait.

113
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,754
- What is it?
- Hang on.

114
00:07:39,214 --> 00:07:40,549
Me too.

115
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:44,678
What's that?

116
00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:47,097
I know better than to show up empty-handed

117
00:07:47,181 --> 00:07:49,600
when I'm invited to someone's house.

118
00:07:53,354 --> 00:07:54,521
What on earth is it?

119
00:07:54,605 --> 00:07:55,898
It's a housewarming gift.

120
00:08:00,944 --> 00:08:02,279
Let's open her up, Commander.

121
00:08:02,363 --> 00:08:03,364
Ready?

122
00:08:13,248 --> 00:08:14,083
What's up?

123
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:17,419
We are not the only ones here.

124
00:08:18,796 --> 00:08:19,713
What?

125
00:08:25,427 --> 00:08:26,845
When did these guys get on?

126
00:08:26,929 --> 00:08:30,766
Did a couple of fruit flies
sneak on board and travel here from Earth?

127
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:33,394
Can you believe these guys?

128
00:08:33,477 --> 00:08:36,230
I paid 70 billion,
and they got a free ride?

129
00:08:36,313 --> 00:08:38,732
Hey, how much did you guys pay?

130
00:08:43,654 --> 00:08:45,572
No! Stop it.

131
00:08:45,656 --> 00:08:47,741
It's a miracle they're here.
Don't kill them.

132
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:54,873
No, don't.

133
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,004
You can't just sneeze them out.

134
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:03,465
Use your words, will you?

135
00:09:03,549 --> 00:09:05,175
They can't understand me.

136
00:09:07,136 --> 00:09:09,221
Did you just hit me

137
00:09:09,304 --> 00:09:13,350
to get back at me for stitching up
your toes without anesthesia?

138
00:09:13,934 --> 00:09:14,935
Shush.

139
00:09:17,146 --> 00:09:20,691
They're not some test subjects that were
pumped full of drugs to get here.

140
00:09:20,774 --> 00:09:23,318
They're the first living creatures
to come to space

141
00:09:23,402 --> 00:09:25,279
on their own, sitting on a banana.

142
00:09:29,575 --> 00:09:32,494
Santi, go buy some time. Go!

143
00:09:32,578 --> 00:09:34,037
- Eve.
- Go!

144
00:09:47,843 --> 00:09:48,677
What's the holdup?

145
00:09:51,305 --> 00:09:52,181
What's going on?

146
00:09:53,557 --> 00:09:54,850
Why aren't they opening it?

147
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,227
What are they doing?

148
00:10:01,899 --> 00:10:03,984
Hey, where are you going?

149
00:10:10,282 --> 00:10:13,785
The male was chasing the female,
and now he's finally sitting down

150
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:16,705
and licking her butthole.

151
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:19,249
They're about to mate.

152
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,294
What's the big deal about
a stupid fruit fly chasing after a female

153
00:10:22,377 --> 00:10:24,630
and leaking her butthole?

154
00:10:24,713 --> 00:10:26,089
You slapped me for that?

155
00:10:26,173 --> 00:10:29,801
Don't you see? These guys are doing
something even humans can't do.

156
00:10:30,469 --> 00:10:32,888
They're creating life in space,
which is incredible.

157
00:10:35,516 --> 00:10:36,892
Look at that.

158
00:10:36,975 --> 00:10:39,436
The male is flapping his wings…

159
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,439
Oh, my God. Do you see how
he's making noise with his wings?

160
00:10:42,522 --> 00:10:46,652
He's trying to impress the female
with everything he's got.

161
00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:48,737
Gosh, it's so noisy…

162
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,240
I've got to observe this. Wait.

163
00:10:51,323 --> 00:10:53,325
Don't touch them, okay?

164
00:10:53,408 --> 00:10:55,118
Touch them? I'm not doing anything.

165
00:10:56,411 --> 00:10:57,871
Hold on a minute, guys.

166
00:11:02,626 --> 00:11:03,919
Look.

167
00:11:04,002 --> 00:11:06,380
The male is holding the female
with his front legs

168
00:11:06,463 --> 00:11:09,341
and bending his abdomen like this.
Can you see it?

169
00:11:09,424 --> 00:11:10,842
You have to see this. Come on!

170
00:11:10,926 --> 00:11:12,427
Wow, come look!

171
00:11:15,472 --> 00:11:17,641
Oh, my goodness. Look at that.

172
00:11:19,685 --> 00:11:20,686
Oh, gosh.

173
00:11:23,063 --> 00:11:24,481
Hold it like this, Dr. Gong.

174
00:11:25,857 --> 00:11:27,484
You see it, right? Can you see it?

175
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:29,403
- Oh, I can see it.
- Right?

176
00:11:33,198 --> 00:11:34,074
That's risqué.

177
00:11:34,157 --> 00:11:35,492
All right, okay.

178
00:11:36,535 --> 00:11:39,037
- They only need 20 minutes.
- What? 20 minutes?

179
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:40,622
They last longer than humans.

180
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,002
Quiet.

181
00:11:45,085 --> 00:11:48,213
Wait, fruit flies can keep going
for 20 minutes?

182
00:11:48,964 --> 00:11:51,967
On Earth,
they risk getting eaten by dragonflies

183
00:11:52,634 --> 00:11:54,803
and still manage to go for 20 minutes.

184
00:11:54,886 --> 00:11:57,014
They literally put
their lives on the line.

185
00:11:57,097 --> 00:11:59,516
And look where we are now. We're in space.

186
00:11:59,599 --> 00:12:01,351
They're doing it in space, all right?

187
00:12:01,435 --> 00:12:02,436
This is

188
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,897
an incredible moment
where they're creating life.

189
00:12:08,025 --> 00:12:09,776
They're doing something that mice,

190
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,237
which represent all mammals,
have never succeeded at

191
00:12:12,321 --> 00:12:13,989
in zero gravity, let alone humans.

192
00:12:15,657 --> 00:12:17,784
We have to wait for them to finish.

193
00:12:17,868 --> 00:12:19,453
We absolutely do.

194
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:22,331
Eve.

195
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:25,751
- Yeah?
- Let me get this straight.

196
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:28,295
So you want to make everyone on Earth

197
00:12:28,378 --> 00:12:32,674
wait 20 minutes
for these fruit flies? Is that it?

198
00:12:36,094 --> 00:12:37,387
You're just…

199
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,519
You're really enjoying this.

200
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:46,480
Just look.

201
00:12:48,732 --> 00:12:49,691
They're going at it.

202
00:12:51,568 --> 00:12:52,819
You got this!

203
00:12:52,903 --> 00:12:53,987
That's it!

204
00:13:05,707 --> 00:13:06,708
EXPEDITION 3 DOCKED

205
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:11,254
It seems the hatch hasn't opened yet.

206
00:13:11,338 --> 00:13:14,466
As soon as it does, we'll connect
with the Mission Control Center

207
00:13:14,549 --> 00:13:16,426
<i>and bring you the live feed.</i>

208
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,721
We at MZ Group,
a leading global enterprise

209
00:13:19,805 --> 00:13:22,182
that delivers new value
with cutting-edge technology,

210
00:13:22,265 --> 00:13:25,727
carried out the 2023-MS-01 Project
through our MZ Central Research Center,

211
00:13:25,811 --> 00:13:30,399
which is equipped
with proprietary technological expertise.

212
00:13:30,482 --> 00:13:33,276
Let me start by
briefly explaining the products.

213
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,612
What the heck is taking so long?

214
00:13:35,695 --> 00:13:37,948
Right. I'll make it quick, sir.

215
00:13:38,031 --> 00:13:39,991
The first one is a cooler.

216
00:13:40,075 --> 00:13:42,577
It weighs 950 g and is made with…

217
00:13:42,661 --> 00:13:44,830
- <i>…the third to enter.</i>
- What's taking so long?

218
00:13:44,913 --> 00:13:46,331
- <i>Once he does…</i>
- He's in space.

219
00:13:46,415 --> 00:13:49,960
<i>…he will have the honor
of becoming the 458th visitor.</i>

220
00:13:51,086 --> 00:13:51,920
Fruit flies?

221
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:53,130
What in the hell…

222
00:13:55,799 --> 00:13:57,634
They're not even official test subjects

223
00:13:57,718 --> 00:14:00,762
but just some stupid flies
that hitched a ride. Are you telling us

224
00:14:00,846 --> 00:14:03,724
to delay the docking and wait for them
to finish their business?

225
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:05,475
Are you insane? This is a big moment.

226
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:08,603
Tell her to open the hatch right now.

227
00:14:09,479 --> 00:14:12,315
With all due respect,

228
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,861
they are doing it on the knob

229
00:14:15,944 --> 00:14:18,905
right now,
so opening the hatch would effectively

230
00:14:19,906 --> 00:14:21,116
kill the mood.

231
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,745
So, I mean, we could not do it,

232
00:14:24,828 --> 00:14:28,874
<i>and maybe they would run into a wall
or we would step on one of them…</i>

233
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,252
<i>But this is a pleasant surprise, so…</i>

234
00:14:32,836 --> 00:14:35,672
I guess all she needs is 20 minutes.

235
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:38,967
You think this is funny?

236
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:43,138
Eve, that goofball.
Just when you think she's doing great,

237
00:14:43,221 --> 00:14:44,389
she pulls this crap.

238
00:14:44,473 --> 00:14:46,641
She's got a knack
for driving you up the wall.

239
00:14:46,725 --> 00:14:48,602
Come on, the flies are making love.

240
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:51,855
Why are you here?
Go start your new, better-paying job.

241
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:53,148
Get out!

242
00:14:54,608 --> 00:14:58,570
Listen, make sure
no one talks about the fruit flies on air.

243
00:15:00,655 --> 00:15:02,574
How about they open it
from the other side?

244
00:15:03,992 --> 00:15:05,952
No, right? That's never happened.

245
00:15:09,956 --> 00:15:10,791
What's going on?

246
00:15:12,459 --> 00:15:13,794
Should we just open it?

247
00:15:14,377 --> 00:15:18,048
I don't think it's ever been opened
from this side before.

248
00:15:42,948 --> 00:15:46,868
I thought you were the type
to never break the rules.

249
00:15:47,369 --> 00:15:49,913
In space, there's no rule

250
00:15:49,996 --> 00:15:52,833
more important
than protecting and creating life.

251
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:55,961
Even though they only live for 50 days,
fruit flies are no exception.

252
00:16:06,304 --> 00:16:08,682
- Eve.
- Call me "commander."

253
00:16:08,765 --> 00:16:09,850
Why?

254
00:16:10,475 --> 00:16:12,727
I like your name.
It reminds me of Christmas Eve.

255
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,605
I hate Christmas Eve more than anything.

256
00:16:21,611 --> 00:16:22,612
Commander.

257
00:16:23,405 --> 00:16:25,615
Let's give these guys some names.

258
00:16:25,699 --> 00:16:27,576
This is a remarkable twist of fate.

259
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:30,412
They risked their lives
to come all the way to space with us.

260
00:16:31,162 --> 00:16:32,622
For the male, how about…

261
00:16:34,583 --> 00:16:35,417
Public?

262
00:16:36,501 --> 00:16:38,044
- What?
- And for the female…

263
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:40,463
Indecency.

264
00:16:41,298 --> 00:16:43,341
- Are you joking?
- I'm not joking.

265
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:48,013
Public and Indecency.
I think they're the perfect names.

266
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:49,222
Forget it.

267
00:16:49,306 --> 00:16:52,183
Public and Indecency. I like it.

268
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:53,810
That's not what they were doing.

269
00:16:53,894 --> 00:16:55,228
That's exactly what it was.

270
00:16:55,312 --> 00:16:58,940
- Sir.
- For God's sake, stop calling me "sir."

271
00:16:59,024 --> 00:17:00,108
I hate that.

272
00:17:00,191 --> 00:17:02,861
Don't you think
you're too fixated on those flies?

273
00:17:02,944 --> 00:17:06,239
That slap across my face was a clear sign.

274
00:17:08,408 --> 00:17:09,618
Nothing better comes to mind?

275
00:17:10,368 --> 00:17:12,537
It's settled then.
They're Public and Indecency.

276
00:17:12,621 --> 00:17:14,539
They're not your pet flies, sir.

277
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:17,626
Eve.

278
00:17:19,794 --> 00:17:21,755
- Eve?
- Call me "commander."

279
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:23,757
You're awesome.

280
00:17:26,009 --> 00:17:27,677
Call me "commander."

281
00:17:27,761 --> 00:17:28,678
Eve.

282
00:17:28,762 --> 00:17:33,350
Eve.

283
00:17:35,018 --> 00:17:38,104
MCC, it is taking a little longer

284
00:17:38,188 --> 00:17:41,107
than anticipated to seal the deal.

285
00:17:41,191 --> 00:17:44,527
The large MZ Confectionery logo
adds promotional potential as well.

286
00:17:44,611 --> 00:17:46,947
Why won't they go into the space station?

287
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,865
What if the ice cream melts?

288
00:17:48,949 --> 00:17:50,033
Won't it be game over?

289
00:17:50,742 --> 00:17:53,787
Yes, it's all over if it melts.

290
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:55,622
Is there something wrong?

291
00:17:55,705 --> 00:17:58,583
What if Ryong was scorched
by that lightning from earlier?

292
00:17:58,667 --> 00:18:00,126
Come on, don't say that.

293
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:02,629
It's not easy to get hit by lightning.

294
00:18:02,712 --> 00:18:05,090
<i>Our team is coordinating
with the control center</i>

295
00:18:05,173 --> 00:18:07,384
<i>to check if there are any issues.</i>

296
00:18:07,467 --> 00:18:09,302
<i>We'll update you as soon as</i>

297
00:18:09,386 --> 00:18:10,929
- <i>we have more information.</i>
- Na-mi.

298
00:18:11,012 --> 00:18:14,349
Our son can't marry the heiress
unless he risks his life in space, right?

299
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:16,685
Otherwise the chairman won't approve?

300
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:19,396
Come on, Ryong said that wasn't true.

301
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:20,897
Of course it's true.

302
00:18:20,981 --> 00:18:23,733
The chairman still hasn't
given his blessing because of us.

303
00:18:23,817 --> 00:18:25,777
His three moms work at a bar.

304
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:28,613
Would you like that
if you were the chairman?

305
00:18:28,697 --> 00:18:31,783
- <i>We've just been informed…</i>
- Ryong is coming out.

306
00:18:31,866 --> 00:18:34,494
- Oh, he's coming out!
- <i>…the hatch is about to open.</i>

307
00:18:34,577 --> 00:18:36,997
- He's coming out!
- <i>We'll switch to the live feed.</i>

308
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,708
<i>All right, everyone.
The hatch will now open.</i>

309
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:42,043
HATCH OPENING LIVE

310
00:18:42,127 --> 00:18:43,128
Here they come.

311
00:18:43,211 --> 00:18:45,296
<i>This is Mission Control, IOU.</i>

312
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:50,802
<i>Official hatch opening time
for G.O-10 spacecraft, 22:35 UTC.</i>

313
00:18:51,344 --> 00:18:52,220
Mina!

314
00:18:52,303 --> 00:18:55,181
- We've been eagerly waiting for you guys!
- Come on.

315
00:18:57,475 --> 00:18:58,685
Let's go.

316
00:18:59,436 --> 00:19:00,645
Commander.

317
00:19:02,981 --> 00:19:04,274
Do you like babies?

318
00:19:05,984 --> 00:19:08,236
Babies. Do you like them?

319
00:19:09,237 --> 00:19:10,655
Who doesn't like babies?

320
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:13,825
All right, then.

321
00:19:50,987 --> 00:19:51,988


322
00:19:52,072 --> 00:19:54,491
Hola, buenos días. Hello.

323
00:19:55,325 --> 00:19:56,367
Hi to everyone.

324
00:19:58,286 --> 00:20:01,122
Ho, ho, ho.
Santa Claus came early this year.

325
00:20:01,206 --> 00:20:03,249
Got you guys a special delivery.

326
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,168
A little something, something.

327
00:20:08,213 --> 00:20:09,255
Ta-da!

328
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:15,470
Wow, you guys are more excited
to see those guys than to see us guys.

329
00:20:15,553 --> 00:20:18,181
- You can tell?
- Well, no kidding.

330
00:20:18,264 --> 00:20:19,599
Hello, everyone.

331
00:20:19,682 --> 00:20:20,683
Hey!

332
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:21,893
How have you been?

333
00:20:21,976 --> 00:20:24,896
Eve! I missed you!

334
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,397
Long time no see.

335
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,697
<i>If I can just get used to
this zero gravity, I can pull it off.</i>

336
00:20:34,781 --> 00:20:37,117
<i>I've practiced a million times.</i>

337
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,326
<i>I can totally do it.</i>

338
00:20:42,455 --> 00:20:45,375
Everyone,
this is Mr. Gong Ryong, the tourist.

339
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:46,459
Say hello.

340
00:20:49,504 --> 00:20:50,839
Oh, hello.

341
00:20:50,922 --> 00:20:52,048
Hello.

342
00:20:52,882 --> 00:20:53,925
Hello.

343
00:20:58,138 --> 00:21:00,723
I… I'm Gong Ryong.

344
00:21:01,487 --> 00:21:02,655
<i>…but he certainly looks excited.</i>

345
00:21:02,738 --> 00:21:03,739
SPACE STATION ARRIVAL

346
00:21:03,823 --> 00:21:07,618
I have no idea what's going on over there

347
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:10,204
because I can't hear them.

348
00:21:10,287 --> 00:21:12,081
Look closely. See if he's okay.

349
00:21:12,164 --> 00:21:15,000
<i>Starting on the 6th,
Mr. Gong Ryong will spend 10 days…</i>

350
00:21:15,084 --> 00:21:16,794
Our boy looks handsome.

351
00:21:16,877 --> 00:21:19,380
There's no one better.

352
00:21:19,463 --> 00:21:20,756
No one even compares.

353
00:21:21,757 --> 00:21:23,300
He made it. It's all good.

354
00:21:23,384 --> 00:21:24,885
Well done, baby.

355
00:21:27,471 --> 00:21:29,265
Great work, everyone.

356
00:21:29,807 --> 00:21:31,767
- Great work.
- Good job, everyone.

357
00:21:31,851 --> 00:21:34,019
- Good work.
- Thank you.

358
00:21:34,103 --> 00:21:35,771
All right, I'll be leaving now.

359
00:21:35,855 --> 00:21:37,314
Are you crazy? Don't be absurd.

360
00:21:37,398 --> 00:21:38,399
What? Why?

361
00:21:41,485 --> 00:21:43,070
Look at you. You all look taller,

362
00:21:43,153 --> 00:21:45,698
and your skin looks younger
than when I saw you on Earth.

363
00:21:45,781 --> 00:21:47,575
Doesn't this zero gravity

364
00:21:47,658 --> 00:21:50,244
make me look at least
three years younger than Dona?

365
00:21:50,327 --> 00:21:51,370
Maybe you're right.

366
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,292
It even straightened out
Santi's misshapen sperm two years ago.

367
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:59,461
So, how long did it take
to get back to your original state?

368
00:21:59,545 --> 00:22:02,214
Oh, gosh.
It didn't even last on my way home.

369
00:22:02,298 --> 00:22:04,216
I wish I would've shown my wife.

370
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,885
I feel like every time
I reenter the atmosphere,

371
00:22:06,969 --> 00:22:08,137
I get wrinkled.

372
00:22:09,305 --> 00:22:13,058
Zero gravity is both
a blessing and a curse.

373
00:22:13,142 --> 00:22:14,560
I'm sorry.

374
00:22:14,643 --> 00:22:16,895
By the way, did you come empty-handed?

375
00:22:16,979 --> 00:22:18,439
Where's the thing I asked for?

376
00:22:20,065 --> 00:22:21,567
But why would you of all people…

377
00:22:23,861 --> 00:22:24,945
Is this what you wanted?

378
00:22:25,529 --> 00:22:26,864
Yes, okay.

379
00:22:26,947 --> 00:22:30,034
You have to share your fruit fly
pregnancy experiment with me now.

380
00:22:30,117 --> 00:22:30,951
All right.

381
00:22:31,035 --> 00:22:32,536
Are those lottery tickets?

382
00:22:33,203 --> 00:22:34,955
Did you get one for all of us?

383
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,834
Hey, we can all watch
the numbers together tomorrow!

384
00:22:39,793 --> 00:22:42,755
But Dr. Kang, what's the point
of you winning the jackpot?

385
00:22:42,838 --> 00:22:44,632
- You already have more money.
- Oh, sorry.

386
00:22:44,715 --> 00:22:47,593
That's not my money. It's my father's.

387
00:22:50,596 --> 00:22:51,513
You okay there?

388
00:22:52,097 --> 00:22:53,891
Yeah, I'm fine.

389
00:22:54,475 --> 00:22:59,647
Actually… I also brought a gift.

390
00:23:03,776 --> 00:23:04,610
<i>Regalo.</i>

391
00:23:08,113 --> 00:23:09,365
<i>Following tradition,</i>

392
00:23:09,448 --> 00:23:12,326
<i>the astronauts who just arrived
are having a welcome ceremony</i>

393
00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:14,495
<i>with the three astronauts
already residing…</i>

394
00:23:14,578 --> 00:23:16,830
Father, I think

395
00:23:18,165 --> 00:23:20,751
there might be a way
to give you a grandchild.

396
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,172
Is this

397
00:23:26,674 --> 00:23:27,549
really possible?

398
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:32,262
Your body is compressed
and distorted by gravity on Earth,

399
00:23:32,346 --> 00:23:34,515
but in space,
it returns to its natural state.

400
00:23:34,598 --> 00:23:37,851
The spine stretches, making you taller,
wrinkles smooth out,

401
00:23:37,935 --> 00:23:40,729
and even the telomeres
at the ends of chromosomes lengthen,

402
00:23:40,813 --> 00:23:42,356
all thanks to zero gravity.

403
00:23:42,439 --> 00:23:45,859
Astronaut Santiago says in that report
that his crooked sperm became straight.

404
00:23:45,943 --> 00:23:47,528
It's similar to Dong-hun's case.

405
00:23:47,611 --> 00:23:49,780
- So then…
- There's a chance

406
00:23:50,364 --> 00:23:53,409
Dong-hun's sperm
will regain normal function in space.

407
00:23:53,492 --> 00:23:55,869
Once restored,
we can inject them into my eggs

408
00:23:55,953 --> 00:23:57,454
and create an embryo through IVF.

409
00:23:57,538 --> 00:23:58,914
We should try it right away.

410
00:24:00,165 --> 00:24:02,209
Who should we send up there?

411
00:24:03,669 --> 00:24:06,380
Send Dr. Gong Ryong into space.

412
00:24:15,514 --> 00:24:16,348
What's that?

413
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:19,184
Ice cream?

414
00:24:20,269 --> 00:24:22,896
How did he know
they go crazy for ice cream?

415
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,149
You miss that soft,
melting sensation up there.

416
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:27,443
They don't have anything like that.

417
00:24:27,526 --> 00:24:29,153
That's a nice touch.

418
00:24:29,236 --> 00:24:31,947
I bet he's trying to promote
MZ Confectionery ice cream.

419
00:24:32,573 --> 00:24:33,615
It's a PR stunt.

420
00:24:34,783 --> 00:24:38,912
<i>No one has ever taken human eggs
up to the space station, sir.</i>

421
00:24:38,996 --> 00:24:42,166
How will you keep the eggs frozen
and sneak them in

422
00:24:42,249 --> 00:24:44,501
without declaring them?

423
00:24:44,585 --> 00:24:46,253
When they tested human sperm before,

424
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:49,465
it was only to check
the astronauts' health.

425
00:24:49,548 --> 00:24:51,633
The IOU would never allow

426
00:24:51,717 --> 00:24:54,261
human life to be created in space!

427
00:24:54,344 --> 00:24:57,181
If I get caught,
I won't be the only one getting punished.

428
00:24:57,264 --> 00:24:59,141
It'll ruin MZ Group, your entire business.

429
00:25:02,436 --> 00:25:06,273
Isn't sperm often sent up to space
for experiments?

430
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,277
I'll have Dong-hun's sperm
sent there on a cargo ship in advance.

431
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,280
All you have to do is sneak in the eggs.

432
00:25:13,363 --> 00:25:15,949
If you manage to create an embryo
using Dong-hun's sperm

433
00:25:16,033 --> 00:25:17,618
and bring me a grandchild,

434
00:25:17,701 --> 00:25:20,954
I'll seriously reconsider
your relationship with Go-eun.

435
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:23,332
No, forget it. I can't.

436
00:25:23,415 --> 00:25:24,291
Hey!

437
00:25:24,374 --> 00:25:27,336
I'm not asking you to kill someone
or steal something, am I?

438
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:29,713
Min-jeong wants to be a mom,
and I want a grandkid.

439
00:25:29,797 --> 00:25:31,590
You're not considering our feelings.

440
00:25:31,673 --> 00:25:35,093
Are those stupid IOU rules
more important to you?

441
00:25:35,677 --> 00:25:37,054
Go-eun can't have kids either.

442
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:39,973
You ended our family line,
so you need to take responsibility!

443
00:25:40,057 --> 00:25:43,268
I ended your family line?
That's ridiculous!

444
00:25:45,646 --> 00:25:47,648
I'll let you marry Go-eun.

445
00:25:47,731 --> 00:25:50,317
Even if you offered me
your entire fortune, I wouldn't go.

446
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,902
I mean, I can't.

447
00:25:52,569 --> 00:25:55,280
And don't try to use a child as leverage.

448
00:25:55,364 --> 00:25:58,659
You can't make deals with human life.

449
00:26:02,454 --> 00:26:03,539
Come on, kid!

450
00:26:04,581 --> 00:26:06,750
If you have to go through with this,

451
00:26:06,834 --> 00:26:09,545
get an ICSI specialist instead.

452
00:26:09,628 --> 00:26:11,797
The procedure needs to be performed

453
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,841
by a specialist, not an ob-gyn.

454
00:26:14,675 --> 00:26:18,178
There are plenty of great ICSI specialists
at the MZ Medical Center.

455
00:26:18,262 --> 00:26:19,471
Look.

456
00:26:19,555 --> 00:26:23,350
Who am I supposed to spill
this huge secret to?

457
00:26:23,433 --> 00:26:25,227
You're board certified for ICSI.

458
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,187
You got certified in the US.

459
00:26:28,188 --> 00:26:30,023
Come on, we're family.

460
00:26:30,107 --> 00:26:32,901
I'm trusting you with this
because you'll join my family soon.

461
00:26:32,985 --> 00:26:35,028
Who else could I trust
with something this big?

462
00:26:35,112 --> 00:26:38,282
I told you, I haven't done it even once
since coming back to Korea!

463
00:26:38,866 --> 00:26:40,367
You're the only one I can ask.

464
00:26:41,368 --> 00:26:43,620
I should give up?

465
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:49,376
I became a pediatrician
because I love kids.

466
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:54,131
I even got married
to have my own children.

467
00:26:54,965 --> 00:26:57,175
Now that I know there's a way,

468
00:26:59,136 --> 00:27:01,221
how do you expect me to just give up?

469
00:27:03,015 --> 00:27:07,519
You're the one who told me
to keep trying without giving up.

470
00:27:07,603 --> 00:27:10,856
Dr. Gong, why can't I hear the thing

471
00:27:11,481 --> 00:27:13,901
that you've said a million times?

472
00:27:13,984 --> 00:27:15,152
"Congratulations

473
00:27:15,235 --> 00:27:16,778
on becoming a mother."

474
00:27:16,862 --> 00:27:19,573
That's the best thing
I could ever hope to hear.

475
00:27:19,656 --> 00:27:22,326
<i>Please let me hear it too.</i>

476
00:27:24,286 --> 00:27:25,621
Ta-da!

477
00:27:25,704 --> 00:27:28,123
Which flavor would you like?

478
00:27:29,207 --> 00:27:30,375
I'll take strawberry.

479
00:27:30,876 --> 00:27:32,377
Oh, but…

480
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:35,213
Oh, come on. Strawberry is…

481
00:27:36,548 --> 00:27:38,675
Give me one too. Me! I'm next.

482
00:27:39,635 --> 00:27:41,762
For you, Ms. Mina Lee, almond.

483
00:27:41,845 --> 00:27:42,930
Thank you.

484
00:27:44,097 --> 00:27:45,807
For you, Mr. Lee Seung-jun, chocolate.

485
00:27:45,891 --> 00:27:46,975
Wow, thank you.

486
00:27:47,059 --> 00:27:49,811
Now, Santi, you get cherry.

Commander, you get mango.

492
00:28:08,205 --> 00:28:10,207
I'll have vanilla.

493
00:28:11,792 --> 00:28:13,085
So this is my gift to you.

494
00:28:13,168 --> 00:28:15,754
I picked them according to your tastes!

495
00:28:22,511 --> 00:28:23,845
Did you declare all that?

496
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,890
Declare?

497
00:28:27,849 --> 00:28:30,269
Oh, why is she dragging it out like that?

498
00:28:31,395 --> 00:28:34,064
I mean, what if he gets caught?

499
00:28:37,192 --> 00:28:39,027
Once you're done, tear off the bottom.

500
00:28:45,659 --> 00:28:47,286
That's the secret space.

501
00:28:47,369 --> 00:28:50,747
I'll put the eggs
under the vanilla ice cream.

502
00:28:51,873 --> 00:28:53,208
Yeah, did you declare it?

503
00:28:54,209 --> 00:28:57,671
The personal privilege kit
is the only storage assigned to you.

504
00:28:57,754 --> 00:28:59,047
It's small,

505
00:28:59,131 --> 00:29:01,008
and you have to pay by the weight.

506
00:29:01,091 --> 00:29:02,759
You're the first tourist

507
00:29:02,843 --> 00:29:05,554
to fill that expensive,
valuable space with ice cream.

508
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:07,764
Of course I did.

509
00:29:09,099 --> 00:29:10,100
Right.

510
00:29:11,018 --> 00:29:12,561
Then can I have the vanilla?

511
00:29:12,644 --> 00:29:14,438
What? No, I…

512
00:29:15,147 --> 00:29:16,523
Hey! Wait, that's…

513
00:29:19,943 --> 00:29:21,862
The commander just took the vanilla.

514
00:29:21,945 --> 00:29:23,739

00:31:30,365 --> 00:31:32,075
Hey, give it back!

550
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,661
I… I can't eat mango!

551
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:39,040
Hey, give it back.

552
00:31:40,792 --> 00:31:42,836
Give it back! That's mine!

553
00:31:46,381 --> 00:31:48,425
Why are you obsessing over this?

554
00:31:48,508 --> 00:31:51,136
You're the one who's obsessing, not me.

555
00:31:51,219 --> 00:31:54,055
I asked you if you declared this.

556
00:31:54,139 --> 00:31:56,808
How many times do I have to tell you?
I did declare it.

557
00:31:56,892 --> 00:31:59,978
I told them I was bringing ice cream
and paid for it too.

558
00:32:00,061 --> 00:32:01,771
They opened each one

559
00:32:01,855 --> 00:32:04,191
and checked what was inside.

560
00:32:04,274 --> 00:32:06,693
Just ask the IOU
or the Mission Control Center

561
00:32:06,776 --> 00:32:09,362
and save me the trouble, okay?

562
00:32:11,448 --> 00:32:14,409
You declared five cups of ice cream.

563
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:21,500
There are five of us
on the space station crew, including me.

564
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:25,545
So you brought five housewarming gifts.

565
00:32:25,629 --> 00:32:26,588
That's fine.

566
00:32:26,671 --> 00:32:29,174
But with this vanilla ice cream,
there are six in total.

567
00:32:33,261 --> 00:32:34,304
One of them…

568
00:32:36,056 --> 00:32:36,973
is for me.

569
00:32:38,016 --> 00:32:39,518
It's for me.

570
00:32:39,601 --> 00:32:42,479
What? I don't need to declare
the one that I'm having, do I?

571
00:32:42,562 --> 00:32:45,941
I put one more
tiny cup of ice cream for myself

572
00:32:46,024 --> 00:32:48,610
in my personal storage, which I paid for.

573
00:32:48,693 --> 00:32:51,238
Should I just sit
and suck my finger while you eat?

574
00:32:51,321 --> 00:32:53,782
Why are you treating me
like some kind of criminal

575
00:32:53,865 --> 00:32:57,285
just because I brought
an extra one for myself too?

576
00:32:57,369 --> 00:32:58,703
If it's not declared,

577
00:32:58,787 --> 00:33:01,248
you can't bring anything up here,
even if it's a gift.

578
00:33:01,331 --> 00:33:04,459
You have to pay by weight
for your personal items, right?

579
00:33:04,543 --> 00:33:07,003
It costs over 100,000 won per gram.

580
00:33:07,087 --> 00:33:09,631
So this one cup of ice cream
is worth over ten million.

581
00:33:10,507 --> 00:33:12,842
Why would you spend
that kind of money on us?

582
00:33:12,926 --> 00:33:14,219
You paid 70 billion to come,

583
00:33:14,302 --> 00:33:16,721
so you're entitled
to enjoy your money's worth.

584
00:33:16,805 --> 00:33:19,182
So why are you trying to win us over?

585
00:33:19,266 --> 00:33:20,684
Why are you buttering us up?

586
00:33:21,643 --> 00:33:22,811
You're acting suspicious.

587
00:33:23,645 --> 00:33:25,105
Is this some kind of drug?

588
00:33:25,188 --> 00:33:26,439
Why didn't you declare it?

589
00:33:26,982 --> 00:33:29,693
Did you bring some dangerous substance

590
00:33:29,776 --> 00:33:31,611
to mess up our experiments or something?

591
00:33:32,153 --> 00:33:32,988
If so, come clean.

592
00:33:33,863 --> 00:33:35,991
Did you bring some frozen poison

593
00:33:36,074 --> 00:33:38,577
to harm us astronauts? Is that it?

594
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,661
Look.

595
00:33:40,495 --> 00:33:41,371
I'm a doctor.

596
00:33:41,454 --> 00:33:43,790
I save people's lives. That's what I do.

597
00:33:43,873 --> 00:33:47,043
Do I look like someone
who's here to harm you people?

598
00:33:47,127 --> 00:33:49,296
I'm even more suspicious
because you're a doctor.

599
00:33:49,379 --> 00:33:50,380
What?

600
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:53,091
What is your problem?

601
00:33:53,675 --> 00:33:56,052
You're familiar with drugs.

602
00:33:58,054 --> 00:34:00,056
Let me eat it and prove it, then.

603
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,517
I'll eat the ice cream,
and that will prove it, right?

604
00:34:02,601 --> 00:34:04,311
If there's really poison in it,

605
00:34:04,394 --> 00:34:06,521
I'll die if I eat it.
Problem solved, right?

606
00:34:07,606 --> 00:34:08,607
Give it to me.

607
00:34:09,441 --> 00:34:12,110
Come on, give it!
I'll just eat it and die right here.

608
00:34:13,987 --> 00:34:17,449
Let's melt it
and see what you've hidden in here.

609
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:22,412
No!

610
00:34:31,338 --> 00:34:32,339
Don't move.

611
00:34:45,435 --> 00:34:49,105
That 70 billion wasn't even his money.
His girlfriend paid for it.

612
00:34:49,189 --> 00:34:52,984
All he has to do is snap a few pictures
up here with her company phone.

613
00:34:53,068 --> 00:34:55,111
Must be nice.

614
00:34:55,737 --> 00:34:58,323
So is the tourist marrying
the heiress or not?

615
00:34:59,115 --> 00:35:02,077
Apparently, he even quit
his ob-gyn job to marry her.

616
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,119
What?

617
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,080
It's nothing.

618
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,417
They say he's just after her money.

619
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:13,088
He's pretending to be in love with her
and even came to space for it.

620
00:35:13,171 --> 00:35:15,298
Everyone's talking about it.
He's ambitious.

621
00:35:15,382 --> 00:35:17,092
What is it? Tell me.

622
00:35:17,175 --> 00:35:18,677
Don't worry about it.

623
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,803
Does Eve know?

624
00:35:19,886 --> 00:35:22,764
That's why
she was against him coming along.

625
00:35:24,766 --> 00:35:27,310
Come on, I want to know. Please?

626
00:35:28,895 --> 00:35:30,397
We're just gossiping.

627
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,564
You don't need to know.

628
00:35:33,316 --> 00:35:34,442
Fine.

629
00:36:02,303 --> 00:36:03,513
Hey, wait!

630
00:36:05,515 --> 00:36:06,599
Keep still.

631
00:36:06,683 --> 00:36:08,768


632
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,648
My ice cream.

633
00:36:29,706 --> 00:36:31,166


634
00:36:31,249 --> 00:36:32,667


635
00:36:32,751 --> 00:36:34,210


636
00:36:34,294 --> 00:36:35,628


637
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:50,101
Where are the spoons?

638
00:36:50,185 --> 00:36:51,811
Oh, here they are.

639
00:36:56,149 --> 00:36:56,983
Let's eat.

640
00:37:04,866 --> 00:37:06,618
I'm sorry I suspected you.

641
00:37:07,452 --> 00:37:10,622
Hey, is it good? Let's share it.

642
00:37:10,705 --> 00:37:12,707
No, not with someone so scary!

643
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,004
Come on, just one bite.

644
00:37:21,549 --> 00:37:23,635
Hey, don't eat it all. Let me taste…

645
00:37:24,552 --> 00:37:25,428
You finished it?

646
00:37:26,763 --> 00:37:27,847
You're kidding.

647
00:37:30,683 --> 00:37:31,976
It's just vanilla.

648
00:37:35,188 --> 00:37:36,773
No! Don't…

649
00:37:36,856 --> 00:37:38,399
This is the important part.

650
00:37:38,483 --> 00:37:40,401
In space, you need to reduce

651
00:37:40,485 --> 00:37:44,239
the size of your trash like this, okay?

652
00:37:45,073 --> 00:37:46,866
Now, come here.

653
00:37:47,367 --> 00:37:50,161
It says "trash" here, right?
Put the trash in,

654
00:37:50,245 --> 00:37:52,872
and make sure you seal it tight, got it?

655
00:37:52,956 --> 00:37:55,750
Otherwise, the trash might float back up.

656
00:37:57,669 --> 00:37:59,504
I will never forgive you.

657
00:38:01,464 --> 00:38:03,091
I hope you enjoy your stay here.

658
00:38:04,425 --> 00:38:06,761
Enjoy my stay? Are you kidding me?

659
00:38:06,845 --> 00:38:08,137
Just move.

660
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,478
Why are you so worked up?

661
00:38:18,273 --> 00:38:19,607
What do I do?

662
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,610
- What do I do?
- Oh, and…

663
00:38:25,238 --> 00:38:27,782
You'll hurt yourself
if you keep flailing like that.

664
00:38:29,534 --> 00:38:32,287
We all once lived in the amniotic fluid
of our moms' wombs.

665
00:38:32,829 --> 00:38:34,914
Imagine this is your mom's womb.

666
00:38:34,998 --> 00:38:37,584
Don't fight zero gravity. Just relax,

667
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:40,169
and try to move naturally like a fetus.

668
00:38:40,253 --> 00:38:41,671
You'll get the hang of it.

669
00:38:44,757 --> 00:38:47,510
What the hell is she talking about?

670
00:38:54,058 --> 00:38:55,059
Wait, what?

671
00:38:58,146 --> 00:38:58,980
Shoot.

672
00:39:00,857 --> 00:39:01,858
What?

673
00:39:09,115 --> 00:39:10,158
Shoot.

674
00:39:25,131 --> 00:39:26,382
Are you sure?

675
00:39:26,466 --> 00:39:27,467
Yes, I'm sure.

676
00:39:30,261 --> 00:39:33,097
<i>The eggs seem healthy.</i>

677
00:39:33,181 --> 00:39:35,391
All right!

678
00:39:35,475 --> 00:39:36,893
We're good to go, then.

679
00:39:41,022 --> 00:39:42,857
<i>I've got the eggs now,</i>

680
00:39:44,442 --> 00:39:46,402
and I also got Dong-hun's sperm

681
00:39:47,028 --> 00:39:51,115
from the cargo ship and stored it
in the portable freezer you sent.

682
00:39:53,701 --> 00:39:57,163
I'll proceed as scheduled.

683
00:39:58,957 --> 00:40:00,249
Sir.

684
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:02,251
What's going on here?

685
00:40:06,297 --> 00:40:08,257
Dr. Kang has the eggs?

686
00:40:08,341 --> 00:40:10,593
Why is he doing
what Ryong was supposed to do?

687
00:40:12,512 --> 00:40:14,764
Ryong did a good job with the delivery.

688
00:40:14,847 --> 00:40:16,391
Tell him to enjoy the tour.

689
00:40:18,434 --> 00:40:21,729
Dr. Gong knows my eggs better than anyone.

690
00:40:21,813 --> 00:40:23,815
He has to be the one to do it.

691
00:40:23,898 --> 00:40:26,401
What do you think
that clown can do in zero gravity?

692
00:40:26,484 --> 00:40:27,610
Come to your senses!

693
00:40:46,713 --> 00:40:48,423
Darn it.

694
00:40:51,509 --> 00:40:52,510
Which way is it?

695
00:41:00,685 --> 00:41:02,395
Guys, where are you?

696
00:41:03,271 --> 00:41:04,522
Where are they?

697
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:14,615
GO-EUN

698
00:41:19,704 --> 00:41:20,872
<i>Hey, Go-eun.</i>

699
00:41:20,955 --> 00:41:22,040
Ryong, hi.

700
00:41:23,207 --> 00:41:24,125
<i>I'm looking for it.</i>

701
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:26,377
I'm on my way
to check the other ice cream cups.

702
00:41:26,461 --> 00:41:27,545
Don't worry, I'll find it.

703
00:41:29,964 --> 00:41:30,798
I'm sorry.

704
00:41:31,799 --> 00:41:33,342
Why are you apologizing?

705
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:35,762
Listen.

706
00:41:39,015 --> 00:41:40,475
You're just a delivery man.

707
00:41:42,143 --> 00:41:44,228
<i>My dad tricked you.</i>

708
00:41:44,312 --> 00:41:48,441
Your job was just to deliver the eggs
to the space station as a guest.

709
00:41:49,233 --> 00:41:51,194
Kang Kang-su will do the fertilization.

710
00:41:51,277 --> 00:41:52,653
- What?
- <i>That was the plan all along.</i>

711
00:41:52,737 --> 00:41:54,530
My dad lied to us.

712
00:41:56,032 --> 00:41:57,033
Who?

713
00:42:00,286 --> 00:42:01,204
Your ex-boyfriend?

714
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,124
That Kang Kang-su?

715
00:42:05,208 --> 00:42:06,501
Mr. Selfish Gene?

716
00:42:08,795 --> 00:42:09,879
What do we do now?

717
00:42:09,962 --> 00:42:12,006
Are you talking about that fucker?

718
00:42:12,507 --> 00:42:14,217
<i>Hey, Eve.</i>

719
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,886
A grumpy male mouse
is having trouble adjusting.

720
00:42:17,929 --> 00:42:20,139
Are you talking about Male Mouse 1?

721
00:42:20,223 --> 00:42:21,265
Yeah.

722
00:42:28,189 --> 00:42:30,483
He was the sweetest one back on Earth.

723
00:42:32,401 --> 00:42:35,822
Is zero gravity too much for you?
What's wrong, buddy?

724
00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:37,615
<i>Hey.</i>

725
00:42:38,282 --> 00:42:40,910
<i>How's the tourist handling zero gravity?</i>

726
00:42:40,993 --> 00:42:44,497
Well, he'll probably get the hang of it
just in time to leave.

727
00:42:47,083 --> 00:42:48,084
Oh, right.

728
00:42:48,584 --> 00:42:51,712
Listen, I rushed out of the house
and left my TV on.

729
00:42:51,796 --> 00:42:53,923
<i>Could you send someone to turn it off?</i>

730
00:42:54,006 --> 00:42:56,092
<i>- I don't want a crazy electricity bill.</i>
- Okay.

731
00:42:56,175 --> 00:42:57,218
Don't worry about it.

732
00:42:57,301 --> 00:42:59,637
Just make sure
you get a mouse pregnant this time.

733
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,805
Let's win the Nobel Prize.

734
00:43:01,597 --> 00:43:03,432
<i>What are you still doing here?</i>

735
00:43:03,516 --> 00:43:05,268
<i>Don't you need to go pack your stuff?</i>

736
00:43:05,351 --> 00:43:07,019
<i>Your junior was offered a great job,</i>

737
00:43:07,103 --> 00:43:09,564
<i>so why are you being so jealous?
It's so obvious.</i>

738
00:43:10,064 --> 00:43:12,150
<i>Do you want me to stay?</i>

739
00:43:12,233 --> 00:43:14,777
- <i>Would you?</i>
- What's the matter? Everything looks fine.

740
00:43:14,861 --> 00:43:16,654
<i>Of course not, they're paying me more.</i>

741
00:43:16,737 --> 00:43:17,738
<i>Exactly.</i>

742
00:43:23,953 --> 00:43:26,664
Dr. Kang Kang-su also got board certified
for ICSI in the US

743
00:43:26,747 --> 00:43:29,167
when he was a postdoc in biology.

744
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:32,837
Since he's already used to zero gravity,
he obviously has an advantage.

745
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,755
I didn't think of that.

746
00:43:35,464 --> 00:43:36,465
I'm sorry.

747
00:43:39,927 --> 00:43:41,095
I won't let this slide.

748
00:43:43,556 --> 00:43:45,183
I'll turn everything upside down.

749
00:43:46,225 --> 00:43:50,897
The chairman clearly has no intention
of letting you marry Mr. Gong Ryong.

750
00:43:51,731 --> 00:43:52,773
Ryong must be…

751
00:43:54,817 --> 00:43:56,777
feeling terrible right now.

752
00:44:06,592 --> 00:44:08,344
Hey. Give me that!

753
00:44:16,393 --> 00:44:17,394
Stay out of it.

754
00:44:18,479 --> 00:44:19,563
I'll take it from here.

755
00:44:19,647 --> 00:44:21,690
You can't take this
away from me like this.

756
00:44:21,774 --> 00:44:22,983
Who do you think you are?

757
00:44:23,067 --> 00:44:25,653
What are you, a thief?
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

758
00:44:30,449 --> 00:44:33,827
You were a delivery man from the start.
Nothing more, nothing less.

759
00:44:41,043 --> 00:44:42,962
Damn it. Kang Kang-su, you little…

760
00:44:44,129 --> 00:44:46,173
I am her doctor, okay?

761
00:44:46,256 --> 00:44:49,468
You can't change a patient's doctor
without their consent.

762
00:44:50,135 --> 00:44:53,222
You've never even seen her eggs.

763
00:44:54,014 --> 00:44:57,309
You've never stayed up all night
trying to figure out what's wrong!

764
00:44:58,185 --> 00:45:02,231
Those are her last eggs, okay?

765
00:45:02,314 --> 00:45:03,691
I know them better than you.

766
00:45:03,774 --> 00:45:06,402
I have to be the one to do it!
Give them back now!

767
00:45:06,485 --> 00:45:08,237
Bring my child back to life then.

768
00:45:10,948 --> 00:45:13,367
- What?
- The child that Go-eun and I lost.

769
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:17,871
The one who barely had any time
in this world. Bring back my child,

770
00:45:17,955 --> 00:45:19,289
and I'll give you the eggs.

771
00:45:20,874 --> 00:45:24,378
Look. Both you and her father

772
00:45:24,461 --> 00:45:27,214
act like I'm a murderer or something.

773
00:45:27,297 --> 00:45:30,718
Go-eun's condition was
more critical than you would think.

774
00:45:31,343 --> 00:45:33,637
You don't care what happens to her?

775
00:45:33,721 --> 00:45:35,431
You want to marry an heiress?

776
00:45:35,514 --> 00:45:37,057
Are you delusional?

777
00:45:38,308 --> 00:45:41,895
Just give up while Mr. Choi is being
nice enough to send you to space.

778
00:45:43,439 --> 00:45:46,150
I didn't come here as a tourist.

779
00:45:46,233 --> 00:45:48,360
- Zero gravity is no joke.
- I prepared for over a year.

780
00:45:48,444 --> 00:45:49,653
In zero gravity?

781
00:45:49,737 --> 00:45:52,114
I've been working on this
in zero gravity for over a year.

782
00:45:52,197 --> 00:45:54,491
Can you handle
a microscopic needle better than me?

783
00:45:55,451 --> 00:45:56,285
Look at you now.

784
00:45:56,368 --> 00:46:00,205
How the hell would you precisely
inject the sperm into the egg?

785
00:46:03,917 --> 00:46:04,918
Give it up.

786
00:46:08,672 --> 00:46:10,007
Go-eun is mine.

787
00:46:48,337 --> 00:46:51,423
Eve, if Male Mouse 1
is still not adjusted by tomorrow,

788
00:46:51,507 --> 00:46:53,300
should we try some medication?

789
00:46:53,383 --> 00:46:55,177
Yeah, I'll check on him overnight.

790
00:46:55,803 --> 00:46:57,971
You must be tired.
Let's get some sleep, guys.

791
00:46:58,931 --> 00:46:59,932
Good night.

792
00:47:01,141 --> 00:47:03,310
This is your first night.
Good night, you two.

793
00:47:13,695 --> 00:47:15,447
You know how to sleep in here, right?

794
00:47:20,577 --> 00:47:23,956
Don't just float around here
like a corpse all night.

795
00:47:24,665 --> 00:47:25,666
Okay?

796
00:47:26,917 --> 00:47:28,585
When will I get used to

797
00:47:30,003 --> 00:47:31,547
this stupid zero gravity?

798
00:47:33,507 --> 00:47:34,925
By the time you go home?

799
00:47:37,052 --> 00:47:41,431
Why didn't you just shoot me earlier?

800
00:47:42,641 --> 00:47:44,476
It's not too late now.

801
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,395
Do it. Shoot me.

802
00:47:46,478 --> 00:47:47,980
Come on, I said I'm sorry.

803
00:47:49,064 --> 00:47:52,234
I can't keep apologizing.
Accept it or not, it's on you now.

804
00:48:08,876 --> 00:48:10,669
You live in this dump?

805
00:48:14,715 --> 00:48:16,091
I'll do it on one condition.

806
00:48:18,135 --> 00:48:19,136
What is it?

807
00:48:20,012 --> 00:48:22,055
I told you, I'll do anything.

808
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:26,852
It can't be just about your grandchild.

809
00:48:26,935 --> 00:48:29,855
I'm risking my life to go to space,

810
00:48:30,689 --> 00:48:34,109
and I won't do it
just for your grandchild.

811
00:48:35,402 --> 00:48:38,488
If I succeed,

812
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:40,991
share the results.

813
00:48:42,993 --> 00:48:45,495
I want MZ Group
to build a fertility clinic in space

814
00:48:46,622 --> 00:48:50,209
so other people in desperate situations
can also have children.

815
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:57,174
A fertility clinic? Who are you kidding?

816
00:48:57,257 --> 00:49:00,844
Just be honest and tell me
you want to marry Go-eun

817
00:49:00,928 --> 00:49:02,554
and live in comfort, kid.

818
00:49:02,638 --> 00:49:04,389
We're talking about my life here.

819
00:49:05,057 --> 00:49:09,478
If I'm going to risk it, it should
at least be for something like this.

820
00:49:14,024 --> 00:49:15,025
Fine.

821
00:49:19,863 --> 00:49:21,448
Fine, I'll do it.

822
00:49:46,556 --> 00:49:47,557
Chief!

823
00:49:47,641 --> 00:49:50,644
GONG RYONG'S 2ND DAY

824
00:49:56,942 --> 00:49:59,111
Oh, God. What the… What's that?

825
00:50:01,238 --> 00:50:02,072
What's happening?

826
00:50:06,368 --> 00:50:08,412
<i>Male Mouse 1 started biting through</i>

827
00:50:08,495 --> 00:50:11,206
<i>the tails of Female Mouse 2 and 3
in the same cage.</i>

828
00:50:11,290 --> 00:50:13,250
<i>Within minutes, he devoured their legs</i>

829
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:15,752
<i>and started gnawing at the bars
with a bloody mouth.</i>

830
00:50:32,019 --> 00:50:34,688
Look at him all messed up
and covered in blood.

831
00:50:35,981 --> 00:50:37,357
He's just like you, no?

832
00:50:40,861 --> 00:50:41,695
This is you.

833
00:50:43,155 --> 00:50:44,740
It'll probably die soon.

834
00:50:48,201 --> 00:50:50,871
<i>I did a thorough check just to be sure.</i>

835
00:50:50,954 --> 00:50:53,248
I found signs that Male Mouse 1 attacked

836
00:50:53,332 --> 00:50:57,753
the females in another cage too,
biting their bellies, legs, and necks.

837
00:50:58,587 --> 00:51:01,506
I get that the zero-gravity experiments
can be stressful,

838
00:51:01,590 --> 00:51:03,050
but we can't just let him be.

839
00:51:04,092 --> 00:51:05,761
What do you mean?

840
00:51:05,844 --> 00:51:08,305
If we do,
he'll kill all the other mice too.

841
00:51:09,556 --> 00:51:11,641
What then? Are you saying we kill him?

842
00:51:11,725 --> 00:51:14,728
We should put him down.
Each mouse costs over two million won.

843
00:51:15,896 --> 00:51:16,730
We can't do that.

844
00:51:16,813 --> 00:51:19,191
The mice are what we send
on the cargo ship the most.

845
00:51:19,274 --> 00:51:21,318
What if they all die? We send another one?

846
00:51:21,401 --> 00:51:22,652
Think about the cost!

847
00:51:26,573 --> 00:51:28,367
Let's stick to their policy.

848
00:51:31,411 --> 00:51:34,706
You're a scientist. If you get
so emotionally attached to a mouse,

849
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:36,583
we can't do the experiments efficiently.

850
00:51:36,666 --> 00:51:38,960
You need to remain objective
as the commander.

851
00:51:39,753 --> 00:51:41,129
This is a test subject.

852
00:51:42,547 --> 00:51:44,966
Just Mouse 1. It doesn't even have a name.

853
00:51:46,134 --> 00:51:48,762
Commander, let's stick to the policy.

854
00:51:50,430 --> 00:51:52,015
If we don't find a solution,

855
00:51:52,099 --> 00:51:54,643
we'll have to keep
putting them down like this.

856
00:51:55,352 --> 00:51:56,478
Please give us some time.

857
00:51:56,561 --> 00:51:58,438
You're wasting resources and time.

858
00:51:58,522 --> 00:52:01,233
We're here to figure out
how we can all live here together.

859
00:52:02,692 --> 00:52:03,902
No, Mouse 1!

860
00:52:03,985 --> 00:52:06,071
Mouse 1 is having a heart attack!

861
00:52:10,492 --> 00:52:11,326
Good.

862
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:12,828
Let's just get back to work.

863
00:52:15,705 --> 00:52:17,124
- Dr. Lee.
- Let's do it.

864
00:52:19,167 --> 00:52:20,335
What are you doing?

865
00:52:25,507 --> 00:52:27,342
Hey! For God's sake…

866
00:52:29,511 --> 00:52:31,096
One, two, three, four, five.

867
00:52:32,222 --> 00:52:33,640
One, two, three, four, five.

868
00:52:33,723 --> 00:52:35,642
What are you doing with a dead mouse?

869
00:52:36,852 --> 00:52:38,395
One, two, three, four, five.

870
00:52:38,478 --> 00:52:40,605
Come on. One, two, three, four, five.

871
00:52:40,689 --> 00:52:43,733
One, two, three, four, five.

872
00:52:43,817 --> 00:52:45,318
Shouldn't you go harder?

873
00:52:45,402 --> 00:52:48,155
No, that'll rupture
his heart and blood vessels.

874
00:52:49,531 --> 00:52:51,283
One, two, three, four, five.

875
00:52:52,033 --> 00:52:56,413
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

876
00:52:56,496 --> 00:52:57,497
What do we do?

877
00:52:58,498 --> 00:53:00,125
It looks like he's gone.

878
00:53:00,208 --> 00:53:02,377
I got a cramp.

879
00:53:02,461 --> 00:53:03,336
I'm fine.

880
00:53:07,215 --> 00:53:09,217
One, two, three, four, five.

881
00:53:09,301 --> 00:53:10,552
Let's open up his chest.

882
00:53:14,806 --> 00:53:17,142
I've never done
an open-chest cardiac massage on them.

883
00:53:17,934 --> 00:53:20,270
I've done it on a newborn baby.

884
00:53:21,938 --> 00:53:23,356
One, two, three, four, five.

885
00:53:34,534 --> 00:53:36,203
One, two, three, four, five.

886
00:53:38,538 --> 00:53:39,581
Dr. Lee.

887
00:53:40,123 --> 00:53:42,375
Hold Mr. Gong's legs with Santi
so he can stand still.

888
00:53:46,463 --> 00:53:47,839
Come on.

889
00:53:57,098 --> 00:53:59,726
- Show me the glove box monitor.
- Yes, Chief.

890
00:54:08,443 --> 00:54:10,070
Could you hold me a bit tighter?

891
00:54:10,987 --> 00:54:11,821
All right.

892
00:54:12,697 --> 00:54:13,532
Scalpel.

893
00:54:34,135 --> 00:54:35,303
Scissors, please.

894
00:54:35,387 --> 00:54:36,680
Okay.

895
00:54:36,763 --> 00:54:38,807
No, not that one. The one on the far left.

896
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:39,849
The far left?

897
00:54:56,658 --> 00:54:57,659
Okay.

898
00:54:59,452 --> 00:55:01,454
Commander, get the retractor in.

899
00:55:08,878 --> 00:55:10,505
Oh, his vitals are dropping.

900
00:55:11,047 --> 00:55:13,383
Give him three micrograms of epinephrine.

901
00:55:16,469 --> 00:55:18,597
- Come on.
- Hurry, there's no time.

902
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,806
You're out of your minds.

903
00:55:41,369 --> 00:55:44,164
All right, relax your body. Relax.

904
00:55:44,247 --> 00:55:45,123
Okay.

905
00:55:48,376 --> 00:55:49,210
Come on.

906
00:55:52,255 --> 00:55:53,298
Come on.

907
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:03,224
Gently.

908
00:56:04,601 --> 00:56:05,977
You're scientists.

909
00:56:06,645 --> 00:56:08,063
You've got to be kidding me.

910
00:56:08,146 --> 00:56:10,607
What the hell
are you doing with a tourist?

911
00:56:11,316 --> 00:56:12,776
You have no idea what you're doing.

912
00:56:12,859 --> 00:56:14,778
Enough! Shut it, for God's sake.

913
00:56:18,406 --> 00:56:20,575
His breathing seems to have stabilized,

914
00:56:20,659 --> 00:56:23,328
but his heart still won't beat on its own.

915
00:56:23,411 --> 00:56:24,829
His heart is so small.

916
00:56:24,913 --> 00:56:27,123
I'm not sure
how much pressure it can take.

917
00:56:28,708 --> 00:56:30,126
His breathing is getting weaker.

918
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,256
Commander, maybe we should let him go.

919
00:56:37,842 --> 00:56:38,927
No.

920
00:56:42,555 --> 00:56:45,016
You've done everything you could.
He's in pain.

921
00:56:46,851 --> 00:56:48,228
No.

922
00:56:52,273 --> 00:56:54,401
They shouldn't have bothered.

923
00:56:57,988 --> 00:56:58,989
<i>No.</i>

924
00:57:08,081 --> 00:57:10,875
<i>Look at him all messed up
and covered in blood.</i>

925
00:57:10,959 --> 00:57:12,752
He's just like you, no?

926
00:57:18,633 --> 00:57:19,509
This is you.

927
00:57:21,011 --> 00:57:22,345
<i>He'll probably die soon.</i>

928
00:57:34,315 --> 00:57:35,150
Commander.

929
00:57:36,276 --> 00:57:38,194
Switch hands and start compressions.

930
00:57:38,278 --> 00:57:41,114
Let's clamp the aortic arch.

931
00:57:42,073 --> 00:57:45,285
A mouse is just like a human,
only smaller, right?

932
00:57:50,749 --> 00:57:51,583
Okay.

933
00:58:00,467 --> 00:58:03,011
One, two, stop. Again.

934
00:58:04,095 --> 00:58:05,847
One, two, stop.

935
00:58:07,182 --> 00:58:09,059
Again. One, two, stop.

936
00:58:11,394 --> 00:58:12,729
One, two, stop.

937
00:58:13,271 --> 00:58:15,607
Again. One, two, stop.

938
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:17,025
What are they doing?

939
00:58:17,108 --> 00:58:18,860
It's what they'd do to a human.

940
00:58:18,943 --> 00:58:20,487
By applying pressure on the aorta,

941
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:23,490
they can make sure the blood circulates
throughout the body.

942
00:58:23,573 --> 00:58:29,537
One, two, stop.

943
00:58:29,621 --> 00:58:32,040
- One, two, stop.
- One, two, stop.

944
00:58:32,123 --> 00:58:35,794
- One, two, stop.
- One, two, stop.

945
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:53,978
His heart is beating!

946
00:59:15,625 --> 00:59:17,710
He lives!

947
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:24,050
Oh, it's beating.

948
00:59:24,717 --> 00:59:26,427
His heart is beating!

949
00:59:26,511 --> 00:59:28,680
His heart is beating!

950
00:59:44,779 --> 00:59:46,739
- You're okay now.
- He's alive!

951
00:59:48,408 --> 00:59:49,409
He's alive.

952
00:59:57,417 --> 01:00:00,420
Si-won, get this on the news.

953
01:00:01,754 --> 01:00:02,755
Okay.

954
01:00:03,548 --> 01:00:05,508
Oh, I knew it.

955
01:00:06,467 --> 01:00:10,013
Listen, Male Mouse 1 had
a mate back on Earth.

956
01:00:12,098 --> 01:00:13,933
Wait, what? Is he alive?

957
01:00:14,017 --> 01:00:15,393
He's alive?

958
01:00:19,564 --> 01:00:22,567
I'm so glad! Hang in there.

959
01:00:27,322 --> 01:00:29,699
There's a reason Mouse 1

960
01:00:29,782 --> 01:00:32,744
only attacked the females, not the males.

961
01:00:32,827 --> 01:00:35,872
He was missing
his mate back on Earth like crazy,

962
01:00:35,955 --> 01:00:38,333
but the females kept coming on to him,

963
01:00:38,416 --> 01:00:40,501
and he had to keep rejecting them.

964
01:00:40,585 --> 01:00:42,962
In the end,
he just lost it and tore them apart.

965
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:46,007
Then why did you send him up there?

966
01:00:46,966 --> 01:00:49,177
Well, it's because…

967
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:51,638
Our mission is

968
01:00:52,513 --> 01:00:55,308
to get mammals
to naturally mate, get pregnant,

969
01:00:55,391 --> 01:00:56,851
and give birth, right?

970
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:00,021
Mouse 1 was
very well-mannered, affectionate,

971
01:01:00,104 --> 01:01:01,856
and great at mating back on Earth,

972
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:04,275
so we figured
he'd get along with the females

973
01:01:04,359 --> 01:01:06,486
and be great at mating in space too.

974
01:01:09,989 --> 01:01:14,035
And you're telling me this now?
Are you kidding?

975
01:01:14,619 --> 01:01:15,620
I just found out.

976
01:01:18,164 --> 01:01:19,165
You're laughing?

977
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:24,420
Oh, man. How did I miss this?

978
01:01:32,428 --> 01:01:35,056
This is amazing. How is that possible?

979
01:01:35,556 --> 01:01:37,350
Can you get me a mouse?

980
01:01:37,433 --> 01:01:38,434
For what?

981
01:01:39,686 --> 01:01:41,229
No, I don't trust your motives.

982
01:01:43,523 --> 01:01:45,400
This restores my faith in humanity.

983
01:01:51,114 --> 01:01:52,198
He's alive.

984
01:01:53,491 --> 01:01:54,492
He lives.

985
01:02:12,176 --> 01:02:13,469
I can't believe it worked.

986
01:02:15,346 --> 01:02:17,515
<i>The very first surgery
on the space station</i>

987
01:02:17,598 --> 01:02:19,851
<i>has successfully saved a mammal, a mouse.</i>

988
01:02:19,934 --> 01:02:21,728
<i>This is truly remarkable</i>

989
01:02:21,811 --> 01:02:24,439
<i>as up until now,
no surgery had ever been performed</i>

990
01:02:24,522 --> 01:02:26,190
<i>in the weightlessness of space.</i>

991
01:02:26,274 --> 01:02:28,026
<i>Yes, this has never happened before.</i>

992
01:02:28,109 --> 01:02:29,610
<i>This surgery has proven</i>

993
01:02:29,694 --> 01:02:33,614
<i>that surgical procedures
are now possible on the space station.</i>

994
01:02:33,698 --> 01:02:34,615
As MCC chief,

995
01:02:34,699 --> 01:02:37,827
I'm so proud of the expedition team
and the tourist who saved a life.

996
01:02:37,910 --> 01:02:41,247
Didn't she want to put the mouse down
until a minute ago?

997
01:02:42,749 --> 01:02:44,167
Not too shabby for him.

998
01:02:48,796 --> 01:02:50,173
Your car will be here soon.

999
01:02:50,965 --> 01:02:52,258
Yeah, okay.

1000
01:02:56,888 --> 01:02:57,805
You…

1001
01:02:58,681 --> 01:03:00,350
Wow! I mean, you!

1002
01:03:00,433 --> 01:03:01,267
Come on, stop.

1003
01:03:01,351 --> 01:03:02,560
Fantastic job!

1004
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:07,315
You guys were really awesome.

1005
01:03:08,191 --> 01:03:09,275
That was insane!

1006
01:03:09,359 --> 01:03:10,318
Hey, move.

1007
01:03:15,114 --> 01:03:17,241
Eve. No, I mean, Commander.

1008
01:03:18,242 --> 01:03:19,702
You can call me Eve now.

1009
01:03:19,786 --> 01:03:20,870
What?

1010
01:03:21,788 --> 01:03:24,040
I never would've thought

1011
01:03:24,123 --> 01:03:26,501
to open his chest
if it hadn't been for you, Doctor.

1012
01:03:28,544 --> 01:03:30,963
I think they can mate now.

1013
01:03:31,464 --> 01:03:33,716
I think they can mate and get pregnant.

1014
01:03:34,384 --> 01:03:35,927
We'll succeed this time, right?

1015
01:03:36,010 --> 01:03:36,969
Absolutely.

1016
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:39,597
I have a really good feeling.

1017
01:03:40,681 --> 01:03:44,685
To be honest, I thought you'd just
get in our way, so you kind of bugged me.

1018
01:03:45,937 --> 01:03:47,313
But you…

1019
01:03:49,482 --> 01:03:50,525
You're a great doctor.

1020
01:03:56,531 --> 01:03:59,659
I'm so glad to have you here in space!

1021
01:04:00,785 --> 01:04:01,869
Great work!

1022
01:04:05,456 --> 01:04:06,541
Let's give him a hand!

1023
01:04:19,011 --> 01:04:20,430
His heart is actually beating!

1024
01:04:20,513 --> 01:04:22,056
GO-EUN

1025
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:39,240
You saved his life.

1026
01:05:25,912 --> 01:05:27,872
SPECIAL THANKS TO CHO JUNG-SEOK

1027
01:05:29,248 --> 01:05:30,458
<i>This is</i>

1028
01:05:31,542 --> 01:05:32,668

<i>I'm in hell.</i>

1030

<i>doing this right now.</i>

1032
01:05:48,935 --> 01:05:50,520
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

1033
01:05:52,271 --> 01:05:53,773
<i>Where did he go?</i>

1034
01:05:53,856 --> 01:05:56,108
<i>Two men in different rooms
with a picture of the same girl.</i>

1035
01:05:57,276 --> 01:05:58,319
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1036
01:05:58,402 --> 01:06:01,280
- <i>It's 500 billion won!</i>
- It's still valid for another month.

1037
01:06:01,364 --> 01:06:04,700
If Kang-su finds out, he'll get jealous
and take them away in a second.

1038
01:06:04,784 --> 01:06:05,701
What were you doing?

1039
01:06:05,785 --> 01:06:08,704
<i>I'm not going to let Kang Kang-su
take anything else from me.</i>

1040
01:06:08,788 --> 01:06:10,540
<i>Kang Kang-su.</i>

1041
01:06:10,623 --> 01:06:11,999
Are you even human?

1042
01:06:12,083 --> 01:06:15,086
I was the one who suggested that
and using Gong Ryong as the delivery boy.

1043
01:06:15,169 --> 01:06:16,963
<i>And it was me who offered to do the IVF.</i>

1044
01:06:17,046 --> 01:06:19,173
You have to do it yourself,
no matter what.

1045
01:06:19,715 --> 01:06:23,511
<i>Right now,
I'm about to steal back my eggs.</i>

1046
01:06:23,594 --> 01:06:26,556
<i>I'm going to get those eggs back,
even if it kills me.</i>
