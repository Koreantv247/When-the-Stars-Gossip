1
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:47,964
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,887
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

3
00:00:54,929 --> 00:00:56,681
Let's all try to get along.

4
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,892
Okay.

5
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,769
A day like this calls for a real drink.

6
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,188
What's this? We're toasting with water.

7
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,149
They're going to air
the lottery numbers soon.

8
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,067
Right.

9
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,736
-We should all watch it together.
-Okay.

10
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:13,073
We need the screen to watch it.
Where did I put it?

11
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,200
Where's our guest?

12
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,411
He's the guest of honor.
Call him out, Commander.

13
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,670
YOU MUST LOOK AT THIS EVERY DAY

14
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,467
<i>You're a great doctor.</i>

15
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:37,055
<i>I'm so glad to have you here in space!</i>

16
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,143
Are you sleeping?

17
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,521
Yes, I'm sleeping.

18
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,191
Hey, come on. I said I was sleeping.

19
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,444
-Aren't you hungry?
-I'm full.

20
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:55,073
But you puked on the way here
and haven't eaten. How could you be full?

21
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,116
I'm full.

22
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,535
So full my stomach's going to explode,
as is my head.

23
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,662
I just want to be alone.

24
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,082
Hold on, are you hiding something here?

25
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,917
What are you doing?

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,002
Hey, there's nothing here.

27
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:09,963
Let me hide Public and Indecency here.

28
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,465
If Kang Kang-su sees them,
he'll take them to the lab

29
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,844
and pump them full of drugs.
They haven't even had babies yet.

30
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:17,512
Isn't there a pocket here?

31
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,639
They're safest with you.

32
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:22,308
-Here.
-Hey! Come on.

33
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,691
Hide them in your room.

34
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:36,030
Come out and eat something.

35
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:39,868
It's zero gravity, so your heart rate
is slow and your blood pressure will drop.

36
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,495
You don't want
your girlfriend to worry, do you?

37
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:04,767
Now, where did I put it?

38
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:07,228
{\an8}Where are you?

39
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,856
{\an8}Where did I put it?

40
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,359
{\an8}There you are.

41
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,952
{\an8}What's this?

42
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,385
How old is this lottery ticket?

43
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:41,679
"Stand by me"?

44
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,641
<i>Across the country,</i>

45
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,227
{\an8}it's the world's favorite jackpot game.

46
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,022
<i>Get ready, everyone. This is World Ball.</i>

47
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:53,733
<i>Good afternoon, world.</i>
<i>I'm Leighton Clarkson.</i>

48
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:58,988
<i>Today's World Ball jackpot is</i>
<i>worth an estimated $246,609,124.</i>

49
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,448
Three hundred billion won?

50
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:02,909
That's a lot.

51
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:05,453
I need some coffee.
Mina, do you want some coffee?

52
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,872
What about the results?
It'll be over soon.

53
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,123
I'll be right back.

54
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,291
Espresso, right?

55
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,418
The biological module is so far, though.

56
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,003
I mean, I would appreciate it.

57
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,130
-What about you, Commander?
-I'm okay.

58
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:17,882
Have you ever won?

59
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:21,803
<i>…you'll need to match all five numbers</i>
<i>and World Ball.</i>

60
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:25,139
<i>So get your tickets out,</i>
<i>pay close attention.</i>

61
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,307
And rea…

62
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,273
Now is the time.

63
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,403
The time to distract everyone.

64
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:44,867
This was the reason
I asked Eve to buy the lottery ticket.

65
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,960
…dy. Here we go.

66
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:25,908
Mr. Chairman.

67
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,535
Surgery in zero gravity

68
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:30,246
requires more precision
and is more demanding than ICSI.

69
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,040
But Ryong did it.

70
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,334
Let's return the eggs to him.

71
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,961
What's the big deal
about saving a single mouse?

72
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,504
It's not like he did it alone.

73
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:40,381
Dad.

74
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,008
Please reconsider.

75
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,092
They're my eggs.

76
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,636
I'm the mother.
Shouldn't I be the one to decide?

77
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,930
Dr. Gong knows my eggs better than anyone.

78
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,140
Dr. Kang doesn't know.

79
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:52,268
But Ryong
has no experience in zero gravity.

80
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,979
If you're going to betray him like this,

81
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:58,357
then was the space fertility clinic
a lie too?

82
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,735
That's what Dr. Gong
put his life on the line for.

83
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,071
Move.

84
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,825
Dr. Gong was the one who
injected my eggs with Dong-hun's sperm.

85
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,118
Father.

86
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,712
It's started, sir.

87
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,300
Time to hit the jackpot.

88
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:29,138
<i>The first number is down.</i>
<i>We have one to lead us off.</i>

89
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,649
<i>By now, he has probably opened</i>
<i>the sterilized glove box</i>

90
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:43,319
<i>and placed Choi Dong-hun's sperm</i>
<i>and Na Min-jeong's egg</i>

91
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:45,822
under the microscope.

92
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,159
Come on!

93
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,161
-Sorry.
-Did we get one?

94
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,455
Sorry. Are you okay? Sorry.

95
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:58,417
-Do we have that number? Shush, quiet.
-Hey!

96
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,377
Wait.

97
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,630
-<i>The next number is 65.</i>
-I can't see!

98
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:06,050
-Do we have that number?
-<i>I wonder who the lucky winner will be.</i>

99
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,385
-Hot ticket.
-We got one number.

100
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,678
<i>The next number is…</i>

101
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,895
<i>He will secure the egg</i>
<i>with a holding pipette,</i>

102
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,406
<i>then use another pipette</i>
<i>to aspirate the sperm</i>

103
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,116
<i>and inject it into the egg.</i>

104
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:37,874
<i>The outcome will depend on the extent</i>

105
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,918
<i>to which the sperm's genetic flaws</i>
<i>have been corrected</i>

106
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,753
<i>in zero gravity, sir.</i>

107
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,218
<i>What will the winning</i>
<i>World Ball number be?</i>

108
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:53,556
<i>Find out right after this short break.</i>
<i>Stay tuned.</i>

109
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,691
Mom.

110
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,527
<i>-Hi, Ryong!</i>
-<i>Hi, Ryong!</i>

111
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,363
Hi, Moms.

112
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,073
Ryong!

113
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,866
It's Ryong. Hi, Ryong.

114
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,409
<i>Have you eaten?</i>

115
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,453
<i>Are you sleeping okay? Are you okay?</i>

116
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,996
<i>Is anyone bothering you?</i>

117
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,623
<i>If there is, let us know.</i>

118
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:01,832
What were you doing?

119
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,167
What else?

120
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:06,504
What were you doing in there?

121
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,005
"Mom."

122
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,384
Is he crazy?

123
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,470
Whatever.

124
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,472
<i>-Ryong.</i>
<i>-Hey, Ryong.</i>

125
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,016
<i>Son, hello?</i>

126
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:33,364
<i>…23, 65, 63, 26.</i>

127
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:36,367
<i>Next, the winning World Ball number is…</i>

128
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,578
I'm getting a call.

129
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,537
KANG KANG-SU

130
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:42,540
Hey, Kang-su.

131
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:44,834
It was a success, sir.

132
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,420
How many did you do?

133
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:50,881
Gong Ryong followed me,
so I couldn't do all ten,

134
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,717
but I got seven done.

135
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,677
He got seven.

136
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,513
If even one of the seven is fertilized,
it's a success.

137
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,181
He can freeze it and bring it back.

138
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,433
No.

139
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,769
They will all be fertilized.

140
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,982
I injected the sperm
exactly into the center of each egg.

141
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,819
Congratulations, sir.

142
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,113
-Congratulations, Chairman Choi.
-Congratulations.

143
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,868
I'm so glad I took you up on your offer.

144
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,621
<i>If you hadn't suggested</i>
<i>using Ryong as a delivery man</i>

145
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,914
and volunteered to do it yourself,

146
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:29,295
I would have relied on Ryong for this
and ended up a nervous wreck.

147
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,883
It was a gutsy move.

148
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,218
Hey, buddy.

149
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:40,056
Check in on my moms
and don't let them drink every day.

150
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:40,973
<i>Okay, got it.</i>

151
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,602
<i>That aside, did the deformed sperm</i>
<i>really straighten out?</i>

152
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,853
<i>Did you actually see it?</i>

153
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:50,358
Hey, do you know
how to unlock the cryogenic freezer?

154
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,068
What?

155
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,319
I can't hear you.

156
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,030
I need those eggs
before Dr. Kang gets it done.

157
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,450
<i>What?</i>

158
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:02,244
Hey, I'll call you later tonight.

159
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,709
Damn it.

160
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,420
Give it here.

161
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,548
Why did you hang up?

162
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,133
He said he'd call again later.

163
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,094
-Later? Later when?
-Yes.

164
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,555
It's so loud there.
I couldn't hear a word he was saying.

165
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,308
Damn it.
So we have to wait for him to call us.

166
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:26,018
You're such a dimwit.

167
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,061
Later.

168
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:31,482
Why does it taste like this?

169
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,858
Like what?

170
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,819
-Can you tell?
-It tasted better yesterday.

171
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:36,737
You always give me…

172
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,284
Can I get another bottle of <i>makgeolli?</i>

173
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,328
-Another bottle?
-I made them yesterday.

174
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,663
We need some <i>jeon.</i>

175
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:47,581
Could we also get some more <i>jeon?</i>

176
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,125
Sure. A bottle of <i>makgeolli.</i>

177
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,584
-I got it.
-Hey, flip it.

178
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,337
Get out of there, you dimwit. Move.

179
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:54,588
-<i>Bye, everyone.</i>
-Bye.

180
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,133
Damn.

181
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,053
I never get any of the numbers right.

182
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,347
Did anyone get any of the numbers?

183
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,975
-Santi?
-Santi, any luck?

184
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:06,976
Nah, I just got one.

185
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,561
Coffee delivery.

186
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:09,562
Did you get any?

187
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,148
No. None.

188
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:13,357
Thank you.

189
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,569
Mr. Gong, please come and join us.

190
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:17,570
Okay.

191
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:21,574
We will have our daily meeting
at 7:30 tomorrow.

192
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,743
As you are all aware,
tomorrow we are scheduled for a spacewalk.

193
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,705
Stand by at the main module
for orders from the control center.

194
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,081
-Okay?
-Yes.

195
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,249
There's

196
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,126
a spacewalk tomorrow?

197
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,670
-We're going outside?
-Yes.

198
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:37,756
One of the panels tore on our way here
because of the SuitSat.

199
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,675
You can't go back to Earth
if it's not fixed.

200
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:43,846
Okay, I'm sure you're all tired.
Everyone, back to your rooms.

201
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:47,391
Santi, cleaning. Thank you.

202
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,621
There's no chair.

203
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:12,541
Commander, is there really
a spacewalk tomorrow? Who's going?

204
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,584
Kang-su is going.

205
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:18,005
So, tomorrow he's going outside
the space station, right?

206
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,841
So what you're saying is,
Dr. Kang is going outside tomorrow.

207
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,176
Why are you asking?

208
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,803
Won't that take more than
a couple of hours?

209
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,056
Three, four hours? Maybe even five or six?

210
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,975
It will take a minimum of seven hours.

211
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:32,603
It's a job that requires
all hands on deck.

212
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,688
Be good and don't cause any trouble.

213
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,731
Okay.

214
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:40,945
Are there cases where you go out
but can't come back?

215
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,574
Are you hoping Dr. Kang won't come back?

216
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:46,951
Yes.

217
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:48,786
No, not at all.

218
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,580
Hey, just because he's Go-eun's ex

219
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,333
doesn't mean
I want something bad to happen to him.

220
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,294
It's because it's dangerous.

221
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,463
That's why we go in pairs.

222
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,258
Have you gone out before?

223
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,802
This will be my third time.

224
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:05,928
Huh?

225
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,139
You're going out tomorrow too?

226
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:10,057
Yes.

227
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,562
Can't Kang Kang-su go alone?

228
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:18,566
Isn't it like, really, totally dangerous?

229
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:21,819
Everything we do here is dangerous.

230
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,280
Why do you have to go out?

231
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,532
What about those people
in there who brag about

232
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:29,702
how they were born soldiers
or born walking in zero gravity?

233
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,537
Are you saying I'm not as qualified?

234
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,205
No.

235
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,667
Remember what you said during training?

236
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,878
Don't you remember?

237
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,588
When you were measuring me?

238
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:43,507
When you were pouring plaster all over me.

239
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,175
What did I say?

240
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,594
Do you want to die?

241
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,429
What I mean is…

242
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:53,225
Can't tourists wear that
and go out on a spacewalk?

243
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,228
Isn't that essential
for this to be a true space adventure?

244
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,774
Spacewalk suits don't have any joints,
so we move really slowly.

245
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:06,113
Moving even 0.00001 mm makes your heart
feel like it's about to burst.

246
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,324
It's like dying in a jointless prison.

247
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,618
You think that's all?

248
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,579
If even the tiniest hole
forms in your glove during the spacewalk,

249
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,040
the pressure inside your space suit drops.

250
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:17,917
If there is rapid depressurization,

251
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,585
within 15 seconds you'll faint.

252
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,962
After 30 seconds, your heart rate slows,

253
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,173
and after one minute,
your lungs, as well as

254
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,508
other vital organs,
will suffer permanent damage.

255
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:28,802
Permanent?

256
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:31,972
And about
a minute and a half later, death.

257
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:36,060
Come on.

258
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,938
I'm sure whoever made it designed it
so a hole doesn't form.

259
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:40,189
Pour it.

260
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,323
Yikes, that's cold.

261
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,617
It's cold.

262
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:53,911
Once the mold is done,

263
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:57,957
a seat will be custom-engineered
to your specific dimensions.

264
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,544
So, you're telling me
I won't be able to wear a spacewalk suit,

265
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,255
and I have to look out at space
through the windows

266
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:06,882
in tiny squares and circles?

267
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,592
You can go out if you want to die.

268
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:12,096
A spacewalk is essentially
a suicide mission.

269
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,641
Even astronauts
write a will before they go out.

270
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:25,359
So, did you write a will, Commander?

271
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,406
In an emergency, the commander is
supposed to be the first to die.

272
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,407
No.

273
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,660
The commander should be the one
to survive till the end.

274
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,672
Where does one learn
how to say such nice things?

275
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:51,260
A space tourist
telling the commander what to do.

276
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,389
That's overstepping your authority.

277
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,700
It looks like your father
took Na Min-jeong's IVF records

278
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:18,495
and any record of theses
on correcting deformed sperm.

279
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,831
He destroyed anything
that could be evidence

280
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:23,167
and left nothing
that could be traced to it.

281
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,960
So, if by chance,

282
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,254
Ryong were to spill everything,

283
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:29,506
he would have nothing to back it up.

284
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,134
Don't you think
your father has gone too far?

285
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,303
He really is a dangerous person.

286
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:38,307
What an asshole.

287
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:42,394
Huh? I'm sorry?

288
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,646
-I must have been out of my mind.
-I was just--

289
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:47,441
I had to have been crazy
to like someone like him.

290
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,360
I'll make you pay, Kang Kang-su!

291
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,995
There are still some signs of jaundice,

292
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,914
but it's nothing to worry about.

293
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:05,084
We're so lucky you caught it early.

294
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,543
Thank you so much, Doctor.

295
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,974
DOCTOR GONG RYONG

296
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:25,938
Are you okay, Professor?

297
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:27,898
You look a bit tired today.

298
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:28,857
I'm okay.

299
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,443
Has the ob-gyn collaborative care meet…

300
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,445
meeting been set?

301
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:37,407
Professor, are you okay?

302
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,325
Doctor!

303
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,327
-Call the ER.
-Okay.

304
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,707
<i>Code blue, code blue.</i>
<i>Department of Cardiology, ER.</i>

305
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,753
Clear the bed, hurry!

306
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,797
Here, take her.

307
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,634
Doctor, tell us what's wrong--

308
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:56,635
Get out.

309
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,265
I'm okay, back to work.

310
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,268
Just in case,
see if the VIP room is available.

311
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,520
She needs rest.
Put the other doctors on standby.

312
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:07,688
Yes, understood.

313
00:19:08,772 --> 00:19:10,858
Professor Na, if you're not well,

314
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,777
any success they achieve in space
will be meaningless.

315
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,487
Don't be stressed.

316
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,781
Does it matter who succeeds?

317
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:19,908
Just think of the baby.

318
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,454
Sir, wait.

319
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,915
What's wrong with her?
Should I call OB-GYN?

320
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,167
Maybe a full physical--

321
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,835
Go. Stop hanging around here.

322
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,753
-Move her to the VIP room now.
-Okay.

323
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,505
-Call only me.
-Yes, understood.

324
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,091
Director…

325
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:42,472
He always wants
all the success for himself.

326
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,743
<i>This is IOU, Mission Control Seoul.</i>

327
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,871
<i>The ILS's internal pressure is 14.7.</i>

328
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,080
<i>All clear. Over.</i>

329
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,125
<i>This is Seoul, Mission Control IOU.</i>

330
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:15,714
<i>We will decompress</i>
<i>the airlock pressure from 14.7 to 12.5</i>

331
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,633
<i>for tomorrow's spacewalk.</i>

332
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:18,634
<i>Copy and out.</i>

333
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:23,055
In normal circumstances, they'd run
on the treadmill for two hours.

334
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,349
They've been busy docking
and operating on the mouse.

335
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,519
The calcium levels
in their bones have already dropped…

336
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,563
They have to exercise
even if it means less sleep.

337
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,606
Should I wake them?

338
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,275
They get mad if you do.

339
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,443
Right.

340
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,076
<i>Did you write a will, Commander?</i>

341
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,204
All right.

342
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,626
Should I do a practice round?

343
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,299
{\an8}MY…

344
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,766
It will be a success.

345
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,394
It will be a success.

346
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:31,331
GO-EUN

347
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,007
<i>If you got the wrong ice cream,</i>

348
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,384
<i>you should have returned it to Ryong.</i>

349
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,594
<i>It's not too late. Give it back.</i>

350
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,598
I was the one who suggested
switching the ice cream

351
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,059
and using Gong Ryong as the delivery boy.

352
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,228
And it was me who offered to do the IVF.

353
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,232
Kang Kang-su.

354
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,191
Are you even human?

355
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,319
Can you even call yourself a man?
An astronaut?

356
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,071
<i>Whatever, screw this.</i>

357
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:05,615
<i>You melon-headed asshole.</i>

358
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,952
Do you think your mother stayed up
all night to raise a backstabber?

359
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:12,164
Spending all that time
shaping your head to make you look good?

360
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,749
You're like a fly on shit.

361
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,667
<i>You're covered in shit from head to toe.</i>

362
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,337
<i>Even if you sat on a pile of shit,</i>
<i>you wouldn't know it.</i>

363
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,048
Do you even know
how disgusting you and my father are?

364
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:23,550
Did you have to go this far?

365
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:27,512
If you get chummy
with my dad, I'll kill you.

366
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,308
<i>You're wrong if you think</i>
<i>this will make me come back to you.</i>

367
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,477
You can't have everything you want.

368
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,354
Don't kid yourself, you asshole!

369
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:40,984
How pretty.

370
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,573
Holy hell…

371
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,494
You twisted sicko.

372
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:07,302
-So, how long did you run for?
-Like, a couple hours.

373
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:08,887
-You?
-Me too.

374
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,013
About two hours?

375
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:13,517
Is this working better
than the one in the observation module?

376
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,393
Yeah. Your treadmill?

377
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:16,812
Absolute garbage.

378
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,189
Don't you think
it's making strange sounds?

379
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:22,943
Yeah, but yours sounds like you.

380
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:25,529
What? What's that supposed to mean?

381
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:30,117
Loser cleans the bathroom. Wanna bet?

382
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,244
Oh, hell no. You've got to be kidding me.

383
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,795
All right.

384
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,014
Oh, my God!

385
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,275
Oh, my God. No way.

386
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:06,319
It's… It's 500 billion won!

387
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,946
It's a 500 billion won ticket.

388
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,700
Oh, my God.

389
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,054
CALL IS BEING CONNECTED…

390
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,639
-Hey.
-What do you want?

391
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,142
You know this place well, right?

392
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,768
-Good job.
-Thank you.

393
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,604
-Have a good day.
-Thank you.

394
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,689
You were rejected by IOU lots of times.

395
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,774
What are you trying to say?

396
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,776
I lost the eggs.

397
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:48,320
The cryo--

398
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:50,238
It's too loud. I can't hear you.

399
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,449
I said, I lost the eggs!

400
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,576
My eggs are in the cryogenic freezer,

401
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,787
but the password is between 0000 and 9999.
One of 10,000 combinations.

402
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,414
You know how to open it, right?

403
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:00,332
Yeah.

404
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,626
Try them all.
It should take you about three days.

405
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,878
Come on, help a friend out, would you?

406
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,964
Isn't there some mathematical trick
that can open it in three hours?

407
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,090
<i>Nope.</i>

408
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,843
Guess that's why
there's no Nobel Prize for mathematics.

409
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,931
Come on, help me out here.

410
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,265
Just take a look.

411
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,185
<i>Why is it so loud there?</i>

412
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:21,144
Oh, that.

413
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,521
It's the centrifuge spinning.

414
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,815
<i>It sounds like</i>
<i>it's going to bust any second.</i>

415
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,401
It's been like that for a while.
They said it works fine.

416
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,486
It's just the sound.

417
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,696
<i>If the centrifuge overheats,</i>

418
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,365
the motor might spark and explode.

419
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,242
<i>Then the fire alarm will go off,</i>

420
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:39,037
<i>and then mission control</i>
<i>will shut down all power to the module.</i>

421
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,039
The power will go off?

422
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,128
Then

423
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,507
the machines will shut down
and the locks will unlock.

424
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,801
That's right.

425
00:25:52,884 --> 00:25:56,471
They'll move all the experiments
to another module before things get worse.

426
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:58,265
<i>That's the protocol for a fire alarm.</i>

427
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,516
Hang on.

428
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,229
It's not just the lab equipment
that uses motors, right?

429
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,108
What are you up to?

430
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:16,491
Does this move only when it's in use?

431
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:20,078
<i>The one in the space station stops</i>
<i>if nobody is running. Why?</i>

432
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:24,916
Then, couldn't I

433
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,502
use my body to start a fire with this?

434
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:28,712
Hey.

435
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:31,256
Don't worry.
I won't do any damage to the experiments.

436
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,675
You're not going to run
until the treadmill explodes

437
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,593
and sets off the fire alarm, are you?

438
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,137
You said if the alarm goes off,

439
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:40,140
the machines will shut down
and the locks will disengage.

440
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:41,599
In zero gravity,

441
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:44,311
your heart can't pump as hard.

442
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,688
The oxygen your blood delivers
drops by a quarter.

443
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,315
You'll die, you idiot. For real.

444
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,776
They'll be on a spacewalk for seven hours.

445
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,112
So when everyone
is focused on the spacewalk,

446
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:58,533
I'm going to deactivate the locks
on the cryogenic freezer

447
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,410
and take back my eggs.

448
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,120
<i>Before the motor explodes,</i>

449
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:05,040
your heart will explode, you idiot.
You'll die.

450
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,625
<i>You're going to die trying to make a baby.</i>

451
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,808
Okay.

452
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,416
Really?

453
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:56,758
Hello?

454
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:06,309
Excuse me…

455
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,154
YOU MUST LOOK AT THIS EVERY DAY

456
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,409
Two men in different rooms
with a picture of the same girl.

457
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,785
Miss Popular, Choi Go-eun.

458
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,004
Mr. Gong.

459
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,173
Mr. Gong.

460
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,386
Indecency is pregnant.

461
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:44,764
Who?

462
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,392
Public's lady, Indecency. She's pregnant.

463
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:53,690
Do you know how hard it is mating
in zero gravity?

464
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:57,736
They pulled that off
even without being official test subjects.

465
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:01,364
If Kang-su finds out, he'll get jealous
and take them away in a second.

466
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,366
-Kang Kang-su will?
-Yes.

467
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,286
Are you saying that jerk
will try to steal Public and Indecency?

468
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,871
He's in charge of the fruit flies.

469
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,330
But why?

470
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,292
These fruit flies
aren't part of his experiments.

471
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,626
They walked…

472
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:16,296
I mean, they flew here
of their own free will.

473
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,464
Shouldn't surprise me.

474
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,675
He's an expert at taking things
that don't belong to him.

475
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:25,054
That's why we have to
keep this from him no matter what.

476
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:26,389
If he gets his hands on them,

477
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:29,893
they'll be injected with drugs,
like the test fruit flies.

478
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,186
And as test subjects,

479
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:34,439
they'll have to live in constant pain.

480
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,483
Even their mating will be studied.

481
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:39,778
And they'll be forced to breed
and give birth, all for human benefit.

482
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,740
I mean, on the one hand,
I feel bad for the other test subjects,

483
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,158
and I'm grateful to them too.

484
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:48,077
But on the other hand,
these guys put their trust in us

485
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,205
and followed us to space.

486
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:52,874
We'll protect them
and help them when they give birth.

487
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:56,878
And then when we go back,
we'll help them adjust to life on Earth.

488
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,254
That's all I'm saying, okay?

489
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:00,256
I'm a doctor.

490
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,343
Pregnancies and births
are my areas of expertise.

491
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,180
I'm the expert here,
not that Kang Kang-su.

492
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:09,808
I can, you know, do a better job.

493
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:10,725
That's right.

494
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,895
I'm not going to let Kang Kang-su

495
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,648
take anything else from me.

496
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,068
Worried he's going to steal
your girlfriend?

497
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,827
Come on out of there.
Go to the CQ and get some sleep.

498
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,245
I can't sleep.

499
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:35,333
I'm becoming increasingly alert.

500
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,132
Let me take a look.

501
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,094
Oh boy, you also have a fever.

502
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,347
You must be worried
the enemy will steal the heiress.

503
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,558
Your veins are about to pop.

504
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,101
Please, that's not true.

505
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,437
You're single, aren't you?

506
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,482
I too have a partner.

507
00:31:09,367 --> 00:31:13,121
Later, when we get back to Earth,
let's meet up sometime.

508
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:15,999
In a year?

509
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,921
We can do that, can't we?

510
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,179
My will.

511
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:31,764
What?

512
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,433
Just in case.

513
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,063
You're giving your will…

514
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,318
Read it after I leave.

515
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,698
You'll find the answer in there.

516
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,417
She's about to give birth.

517
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,418
See?

518
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,423
Did you see that?

519
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:08,593
Push.

520
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,597
Breathe, Indecency, breathe.

521
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,666
I see you called multiple times.

522
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:42,168
<i>I called all night.</i>
<i>Why didn't you pick up?</i>

523
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,129
Is there anyone beside you?

524
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,923
<i>Go somewhere you can be alone.</i>

525
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:48,800
What?

526
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,594
Really?

527
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,472
Are you serious?

528
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,103
It's 500 billion won, Dona.

529
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,485
The prize money…

530
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,155
You have a year
to claim the winnings, right?

531
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,991
<i>Right, Mina?</i>

532
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,410
It's still valid for another month.

533
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:19,288
We can still claim the money.

534
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,708
The lottery ticket is still valid.

535
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,795
We're going to be rich, Mina.

536
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,006
Dona.

537
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,050
But this ticket isn't ours.

538
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:34,137
You don't know who it belongs to.
Nobody does.

539
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,932
Whoever lost it
hasn't looked for it in a year.

540
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,435
It doesn't belong to anyone.

541
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:44,731
The person who wrote
"Stand by me" is probably the owner.

542
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,482
You…

543
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,071
You need to hide that
in a safe place, got it?

544
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:57,035
Return that ticket,
and you can forget you have a twin.

545
00:33:58,661 --> 00:33:59,579
Okay.

546
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:04,417
It's… It's 500 billion won.

547
00:34:37,283 --> 00:34:38,409
<i>I am rich!</i>

548
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,759
<i>Wow!</i>

549
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:57,637
<i>Thank you.</i>

550
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:06,813
<i>I am rich.</i>

551
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:11,984
<i>Thank you.</i>

552
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,880
<i>This is Seoul.</i>

553
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,675
<i>The 141st spacewalk mission is</i>

554
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,886
{\an8}<i>to remove the damaged solar panel</i>
<i>of the G.O-10.</i>

555
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,304
{\an8}GONG RYONG'S 3RD DAY

556
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:43,057
{\an8}Okay, I just turned off all the power
to the solar panels.

557
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,475
<i>Copy. Radio check, over.</i>

558
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,060
Radio check.

559
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,980
Radio is okay.

560
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:52,316
I'll keep the comms open
in case there's an emergency, all right?

561
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,234
<i>Copy.</i>

562
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,195
<i>The mission will be over</i>
<i>with the robot arm</i>

563
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,615
<i>putting the disengaged panels</i>
<i>into the trash cargo</i>

564
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:03,619
<i>once EV1 and EV2 remove</i>
<i>the torn panels from the spacecraft.</i>

565
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,706
<i>If you see any sign of danger,</i>

566
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:10,168
<i>you two abort the mission</i>
<i>and get back inside, okay?</i>

567
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,836
<i>EV1, copy.</i>

568
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,004
<i>Copy, Seoul.</i>

569
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,631
{\an8}EV: CALL SIGN FOR ASTRONAUTS
WORKING OUTSIDE SPACECRAFT

570
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:01,052
EV1, departing ahead to the mission point.

571
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,948
DR. GONG RYONG

572
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,368
<i>Hello, Dr. Na.</i>

573
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,496
I'll ask this one last time
as your doctor.

574
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,416
If you say you are fine
with Kang Kang-su working on it,

575
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:34,919
I will step aside.

576
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,213
Do you want to put him in charge?

577
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,590
No.

578
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,884
Our situation

579
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:45,263
isn't just a simple case of
inserting sperm into an egg.

580
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,848
<i>We need you to monitor Dong-hun's sperm</i>

581
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:49,850
to see if the genetic flaws are corrected

582
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,645
as it reshapes itself,
ensuring successful fertilization

583
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:55,314
and embryonic development

584
00:37:55,398 --> 00:37:57,233
<i>up to the morula stage.</i>

585
00:37:57,817 --> 00:38:00,945
<i>That's why I persuaded the chairman</i>
<i>that it had to be you.</i>

586
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:09,328
Right now,
I'm about to steal back my eggs.

587
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,045
<i>You have to do it yourself,</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

588
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,047
<i>I'm counting on you.</i>

589
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:27,221
I'm going to get those eggs back,
even if it kills me.

590
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,597
DR. NA MIN-JEONG

591
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,861
EV1, commencing work.

592
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,428
<i>Seoul, the sun is coming back around.</i>

593
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,555
<i>Lower your sunshade.</i>
<i>Hurry, or it could be disastrous.</i>

594
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,557
EV1, copy.

595
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:55,684
EV2, copy.

596
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,736
On Earth, this would take ten seconds.

597
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,406
We've been doing this for ten minutes.

598
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,765
<i>Careful, don't drop the screws.</i>

599
00:40:34,849 --> 00:40:38,769
<i>Any lost tool can become a projectile</i>
<i>and strike the space station.</i>

600
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,271
EV1, copy.

601
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:41,564
EV2, copy.

602
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:06,297
EV1, I'm removing the last screw.

603
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,517
This one's a bit tighter than
the last one.

604
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,042
Are you okay, Commander?

605
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,126
Geez!

606
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:45,961
Are you okay?

607
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,546
Eve, are you okay?

608
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,089
I'm fine.

609
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,719
<i>You need to be careful, Eve.</i>

610
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:55,930
<i>Secure your footing first.</i>

611
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:57,723
Copy.

612
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:14,156
<i>Eve, if you grab too tightly,</i>
<i>it's dangerous. Be careful and go slow.</i>

613
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,410
That was a close one.

614
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,587
Okay, the screw's loose.

615
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,423
All you have to do now
is pass the panel to the robot arm.

616
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,550
Copy.

617
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:41,118
<i>Observation deck, the robot arm</i>
<i>has grasped the folded solar panel.</i>

618
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,749
Okay, EV1 and EV2

619
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:50,502
will now secure
the folded solar panel with rope.

620
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:58,135
What's that?

621
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:01,138
Whose is that? What's happening?

622
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,306
What is going on?

623
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:04,099
-Is it the commander?
<i>-Is it Dr. Kang?</i>

624
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:10,981
{\an8}What's going on?

625
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,404
Dr. Kang. Is everything okay?

626
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,866
Everything

627
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:23,410
is not okay.

628
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,456
Kang Kang-su.

629
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:31,627
Nothing bad is going to happen to you
just because I wished you ill, is it?

630
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,047
Come back.

631
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:37,466
Come back.

632
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,301
Hurry, come back.

633
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,269
<i>What's your suit pressure reading?</i>

634
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,522
EV2, 3.9 psia.

635
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:55,025
EV2, body temperature is 38 degrees
and heart rate has dropped to 70.

636
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,443
Check your gloves.

637
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:00,239
No sign of a leak in the gloves.

638
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:02,199
I can't pinpoint the source of the leak.

639
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:06,203
Anything below 4.0 is cause for concern.

640
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:09,331
Dr. Kang, return
to the station immediately.

641
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:10,916
No. I'm going to finish the job.

642
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,084
Dr. Kang, go back.

643
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:14,211
If the pressure drops,
you'll be in trouble.

644
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,963
I should be done in less than ten minutes.

645
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:21,844
If you stay here,
you'll make me too nervous to work.

646
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:24,471
Stop wasting precious oxygen,
and get back inside.

647
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,352
What is it now?

648
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:34,106
That's the sound
of the fire alarm in the space station.

649
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,734
<i>What? Where in the space station?</i>

650
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,721
<i>It's the biological module.</i>

651
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,139
A fire out of the blue?

652
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,891
The thing is, a few days ago,

653
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:11,685
the centrifuge motor
started to sound a bit off.

654
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:13,770
<i>It's possible</i>
<i>that a spark came from there.</i>

655
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,231
<i>Is it empty? Is there someone in there?</i>

656
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,691
<i>Could Mr. Gong be in there?</i>

657
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:19,693
<i>Our crew is heading to the module now.</i>

658
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:22,738
I don't see him on the CCTV.
Where the hell could he be?

659
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:25,407
Is the lab equipment unlocked now?

660
00:46:25,491 --> 00:46:27,075
Yes, they unlocked automatically.

661
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,077
<i>Dr. Lee, first check if everyone is safe.</i>

662
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:32,080
Once confirmed, now that the power is off
and the locks are open,

663
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:35,375
hurry and move the samples
to the main module before they thaw.

664
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,376
Copy.

665
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:43,592
Then is Mr. Gong in the biological module?

666
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:46,011
Are the locks open?

667
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,639
Stop being stubborn,
and go back inside, Dr. Kang.

668
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,057
<i>Hurry. That's an order!</i>

669
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:51,892
I'm done here.

670
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,937
Go inside, Dr. Kang.
The job here is almost complete.

671
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:01,818
I'm sorry.

672
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:37,563
Mr. Gong.

673
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,565
-Mr. Gong?
-Mr. Gong.

674
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,066
Shit…

675
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:44,236
-Oh, my plants. I can't believe this.
-Mr. Gong.

676
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:45,821
Where did he go?

677
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:46,822
Mr. Gong?

678
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:49,825
What are you doing over there?

679
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:51,118
I don't see a fire.

680
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,245
What is all that smoke?

681
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:01,169
Mr. Gong, what are you doing?

682
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,296
Shit.

683
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,512
That's mine!

684
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:13,849
I…

685
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,351
Are you okay? What are you doing?

686
00:48:17,644 --> 00:48:18,937
Are you hurt?

687
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:20,564
No.

688
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:24,693
I was looking for the fire extinguisher.

689
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:26,612
<i>I was on the treadmill,</i>

690
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,655
and I saw smoke coming from the motor.

691
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:30,365
That's what caused the commotion.

692
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,451
Sorry about that.

693
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:36,663
<i>Sorry. You must have been alarmed.</i>

694
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:43,503
<i>Just how fast were you running</i>

695
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,839
<i>to make the treadmill motor smoke?</i>

696
00:48:45,922 --> 00:48:47,799
<i>Were you trying to kill yourself?</i>

697
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,635
At that rate, your heart will explode.

698
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:52,304
<i>Were you born with two hearts?</i>
<i>Or maybe you have three.</i>

699
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:54,681
Did your money
buy you more than one heart?

700
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:56,224
Are you crazy?

701
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,226
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

702
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,020
What, is dying in space cool?

703
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,146
<i>That's enough.</i>

704
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:04,524
I told him to get some exercise
while we were out here.

705
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,861
<i>It was his first time working out here.</i>

706
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:10,322
It's my fault.
I didn't tell him how to work out.

707
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,032
How could he know?

708
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,497
Okay, let's drop it.

709
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,290
It's fine as long as Mr. Gong isn't hurt.

710
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,500
It's not a big deal.

711
00:49:21,583 --> 00:49:25,921
The sensors are extremely sensitive,
so the alarms sometimes go off, right?

712
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,881
Thankfully, it wasn't a big accident.

713
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,842
Hurry and restore power
to the biological module.

714
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:33,136
Aren't the samples fine
if it's been under three minutes?

715
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,348
-They can stay put, right?
-Right. It hasn't even been a minute.

716
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:37,974
<i>Okay.</i>

717
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,818
I'm so sorry.

718
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:50,529
What's in your hand?

719
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,281
Huh?

720
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,745
Oh, this…

721
00:50:00,455 --> 00:50:02,541
I brought this from Earth.

722
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:05,252
It's something I recorded
for when I'm working out.

723
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:08,839
Do you want to listen?

724
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:12,676
Put that away. Screw your music.

725
00:50:14,428 --> 00:50:18,306
From now on, you have to get
our permission before working out.

726
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,100
Is that understood?

727
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:22,602
Yes.

728
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,105
First, go and get some rest.
You must have been scared.

729
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,733
You might have caused
some strain on your heart.

730
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:28,775
Okay.

731
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,863
Now where are you going?

732
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:37,284
Is it okay if I get some water?

733
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,202
Sure, let's go.

734
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:43,331
I'll get you some water.
You go lie down in the CQ.

735
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:44,708
Okay.

736
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,883
EV2 has returned to the station.

737
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,760
I'm going to pick up the pace.

738
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,363
I connected the umbilical cable.

739
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:34,090
<i>EV2, body temperature is 37 degrees,</i>
<i>heart rate is 75 and stabilizing.</i>

740
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,603
Don't go anywhere.

741
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:49,689
If you leave this room,
we'll send you back to Earth immediately.

742
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,486
Stay put.

743
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:11,628
Finally…

744
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:17,425
I did it.

745
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:30,981
<i>Seoul, that should be secure enough.</i>

746
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,942
I'm going to wrap it one final time.

747
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:56,608
Let's see

748
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,946
what she wrote in her will.

749
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,623
<i>Grab whatever you can, Eve.</i>

750
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,428
I've got it.

751
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:10,056
<i>She's got a hold of it.</i>

752
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,017
<i>Eve, are you okay?</i>

753
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:15,186
Yes, I'm okay.

754
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:20,734
<i>Hey, don't do this to me.</i>

755
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:24,529
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

756
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:27,574
I'm sorry.

757
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:30,952
I think my glove is damaged.

758
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,913
What?

759
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:39,544
{\an8}How bad is the damage?
Is it a suit pressure emergency?

760
00:55:39,627 --> 00:55:40,920
{\an8}SPACE SUIT PRESSURE LEAK CODE

761
00:55:42,380 --> 00:55:45,133
A piece of the panel at least 6 mm in size

762
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:47,552
appears to have penetrated
the pressurized layer.

763
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,304
So, are you hurt? How bad is it, Eve?

764
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:51,056
<i>Enough that my palm stings.</i>

765
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:53,850
But I don't think it's cut.

766
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,270
<i>Don't move your hand.</i>

767
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:59,856
If you do, you'll lose oxygen
and become unconscious in 15 seconds.

768
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:02,400
Then fatal damage to your organs
after a minute.

769
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:03,359
Copy.

770
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,612
Screw the solar panels.
Get back inside, now.

771
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,238
Mina, get ready to pull her in.

772
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:08,364
Copy, airlock.

773
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:12,202
<i>Okay. Don't move your hand.</i>

774
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:15,747
I'm going to move the solar panel
with the commander to the airlock door.

775
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:17,749
Eve, unhook the safety tether.

776
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:36,392
I think the hook is broken.

777
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:37,811
<i>It won't open.</i>

778
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:41,106
Then you have to release
the safety tether attached to G.O-10.

779
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:44,526
Commander, can you do it?

780
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:48,321
I'll try. Get me as close as you can.

781
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,303
Okay.

782
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:33,992
<i>Commander, can you reach?</i>

783
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:38,621
The solar panel is too wide.
I can't reach it.

784
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:42,709
Rotate it at an angle
and try to get me closer.

785
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,461
Okay, I'll try rotating it.

786
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:57,307
Okay, EV1 is approaching.

787
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:09,944
Shit.

788
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:11,738
<i>Are you okay, Eve?</i>

789
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:14,949
I'm okay.

790
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,411
I can't bring you any closer.

791
00:58:19,871 --> 00:58:20,830
Okay.

792
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:38,473
Commander, no.

793
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,375
I'm losing my mind here.

794
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,843
Hey, Seung-jun.

795
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:24,811
Dr. Lee.

796
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,438
Airlock 1, I'm going to go
and unhook the safety tether.

797
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:32,652
Guys, I'm going to Airlock 2.
It'll be faster to decompress from there.

798
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:36,239
<i>No, Santi.</i>
<i>Someone has to cover the robot arm.</i>

799
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:38,408
<i>He's right, Santi. Hold your position.</i>

800
00:59:38,491 --> 00:59:39,993
<i>I need you to stay there.</i>

801
00:59:40,076 --> 00:59:41,077
For Christ's sake!

802
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:44,247
Please.

803
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,165
Come on.

804
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:06,227
EV1, body temperature 37.3 degrees,
your heart rate…

805
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:07,729
Fifty-seven?

806
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,735
Eve, check your glove. Is the hole bigger?

807
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:15,194
<i>Her ECG levels are falling.</i>

808
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:17,322
EV1, check your CO2 levels.

809
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:19,157
EV1?

810
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,408
EV1?

811
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:29,876
<i>Eve!</i>

812
01:00:29,959 --> 01:00:31,169
Eve, stay with me.

813
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,051
<i>Eve!</i>

814
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:40,136
<i>Stay with me, Eve!</i>

815
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:42,972
<i>Open your eyes, Eve. Are you okay?</i>

816
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:44,974
<i>Stay awake!</i>

817
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:20,551
<i>Eve!</i>

818
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:47,161

{\an8}EV1's heart rate is dropping fast.

820
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:51,999
{\an8}I think I'm fine.

821
01:01:53,251 --> 01:01:54,127
{\an8}Look at me. Eve!

822
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:58,506

823
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:00,466

824
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:02,385
{\an8}<i>Please make it home safe and sound.</i>

825
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:03,302

no questions asked.

828
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:11,185
{\an8}I guess you can't do anything now.

829
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:12,979
{\an8}<i>Let me clue you in on something.</i>
