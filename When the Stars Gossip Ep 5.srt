00:00:08,243 --> 00:00:13,164
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:21,673
{\an8}INCOMING CALL

3
00:00:21,756 --> 00:00:24,926
{\an8}YI-MANIAC

4
00:00:50,034 --> 00:00:51,369
{\an8}Hey!

5
00:00:54,747 --> 00:00:57,041
{\an8}How do you feel? Are you okay?

6
00:00:58,126 --> 00:01:01,963
{\an8}I'm so embarrassed
I don't think I can leave the CQ.

7
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:06,884
{\an8}I don't think I'll ever be able to leave
this tiny room.

8
00:01:08,344 --> 00:01:09,220
{\an8}Why not?

9
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:12,265
{\an8}What did you do now?

10
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:17,020
Santi.

11
00:01:17,103 --> 00:01:19,480
I didn't see anything! I know nothing.

12
00:01:19,564 --> 00:01:20,398
Nice, juicy muscles.

13
00:01:22,025 --> 00:01:23,568
From now on, I'm lying low.

14
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:25,528
I'm going to keep my distance.

15
00:01:26,154 --> 00:01:28,781
I'm going to keep a low profile,
make the IVF a success,

16
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:31,200
and go back as fast as I can.

17
00:01:35,788 --> 00:01:36,914
YESTERDAY

18
00:01:51,054 --> 00:01:53,848
Oh, my God!

19
00:01:55,475 --> 00:01:59,103
Eve, only you can see it now.

20
00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:04,650
Only you can see it!

21
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:14,911
…you were really going to die--

22
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,665
<i>The accident that could've ended with</i>
<i>just me dying almost killed two people.</i>

23
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:21,292
<i>Have you been drinking?</i>

24
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:22,418
<i>Yeah.</i>

25
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:25,671
<i>Look, what did I do that was so wrong?</i>

26
00:02:26,297 --> 00:02:28,424
<i>Even if I could go back,</i>
<i>I'd do the same thing.</i>

27
00:02:28,508 --> 00:02:31,886
<i>Open up the hatch,</i>
<i>jump out like an idiot, and save you.</i>

28
00:02:31,969 --> 00:02:33,304
<i>Would I have been rewarded</i>

29
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:36,057
<i>if I had let you die</i>
<i>while decompressing and suiting up?</i>

30
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,392
<i>What I did was good.</i>
<i>I did the right thing.</i>

31
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:40,311
<i>Give me a pat</i>
<i>and tell me I did the right thing.</i>

32
00:02:40,394 --> 00:02:42,188
<i>Come on, just say thank you.</i>

33
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,527
Where did you get the alcohol?

34
00:02:49,028 --> 00:02:50,279
Is it okay if I like you?

35
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:54,909
No?

36
00:02:59,622 --> 00:03:02,333
-You're drunk.
-I'm not drunk at all.

37
00:03:07,672 --> 00:03:08,673
Is that okay?

38
00:03:12,427 --> 00:03:13,261
It's not okay.

39
00:03:14,178 --> 00:03:15,680
Think about it before you answer.

40
00:03:17,557 --> 00:03:18,766
I'll give you some time.

41
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,976
Hey!

42
00:03:20,768 --> 00:03:22,186
I don't need time.

43
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:26,065
It's a question
that doesn't deserve consideration.

44
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:29,110
You come here drunk and talking nonsense.
Why should I answer that?

45
00:03:30,528 --> 00:03:33,364
We both have partners.

46
00:03:33,448 --> 00:03:34,407
Are you crazy?

47
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:37,452
Actually,
you've been acting crazy all day.

48
00:03:37,535 --> 00:03:41,789
All day long, from the minute
you jumped out into space to save me.

49
00:03:43,249 --> 00:03:45,835
And then you had a drink,
which is off-limits…

50
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:49,547
Are you crazy? Are you nuts?

51
00:03:55,094 --> 00:03:58,389
Just shut your mouth and go to sleep.

52
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,309
Does it make you feel better
to dismiss this

53
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:03,269
as me just being a stupid drunk?

54
00:04:03,352 --> 00:04:05,271
You can't even get drunk up here.

55
00:04:05,354 --> 00:04:08,149
A few drops of alcohol
just made me a bit braver, is all.

56
00:04:08,691 --> 00:04:09,525
Get out.

57
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:13,738
I'm going back down in a few days.

58
00:04:14,614 --> 00:04:17,241
You won't be back for a year,
so I have to say this now.

59
00:04:19,035 --> 00:04:22,538
I can't go back to Earth
pretending like nothing happened here.

60
00:04:24,123 --> 00:04:25,958
I don't want to lie to myself.

61
00:04:29,754 --> 00:04:30,588
Leave.

62
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,259
-Get out.
-Come on, wait a second.

63
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:37,261
-Get out! Now!
-Just wait.

64
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:38,513
Get out.

65
00:04:38,596 --> 00:04:39,889
I said get out!

66
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,226
Come on, Commander.

67
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,894
Commander.

68
00:04:55,071 --> 00:04:56,072
Hello?

69
00:05:01,827 --> 00:05:02,828
Mr. Gong?

70
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:08,709
Mr. Gong, are you sleeping?

71
00:05:19,512 --> 00:05:20,930
He really put a dent in it.

72
00:05:41,784 --> 00:05:42,743
You scared me!

73
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:44,662
Why did you open the door?

74
00:05:47,248 --> 00:05:48,374
Curious if I left?

75
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:51,294
No, I'm not curious.

76
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:57,842
What the hell?

77
00:05:57,925 --> 00:05:59,176
What's with you?

78
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,262
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

79
00:06:01,345 --> 00:06:02,847
Stop it, I'm serious!

80
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,473
I came in because you opened the door.

81
00:06:04,557 --> 00:06:07,435
If you hadn't,
I wouldn't have been able to come in.

82
00:06:07,518 --> 00:06:11,188
I'm not that bold or shameless.

83
00:06:11,272 --> 00:06:12,398
Thank you.

84
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:16,444
It's because you were annoying me.

85
00:06:16,527 --> 00:06:19,113
If you hadn't left,
I would have kicked you out.

86
00:06:19,864 --> 00:06:21,240
It's nice

87
00:06:22,742 --> 00:06:23,909
that you were curious.

88
00:06:27,204 --> 00:06:30,333
Come on, do you know how hard it was

89
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,460
to work up the nerve to come and tell you?

90
00:06:32,543 --> 00:06:35,880
It'd be so unfair to be kicked out
without finishing what I came to say.

91
00:06:35,963 --> 00:06:37,965
I'm not expecting you
to answer on the spot.

92
00:06:38,049 --> 00:06:40,635
I know how strange I'm acting.

93
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:44,138
As an ob-gyn,

94
00:06:44,221 --> 00:06:46,432
I only see women
in the OR, exam room, and ER.

95
00:06:46,515 --> 00:06:49,727
I'm always in one of those places,
surrounded by pregnant women,

96
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,271
so I only see women as patients.

97
00:06:53,356 --> 00:06:58,361
But this weightlessness
has done something to my heart.

98
00:06:58,444 --> 00:07:00,488
You made me like this.

99
00:07:00,571 --> 00:07:03,074
You slapped me silly
and made me like this.

100
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:05,368
You and zero gravity are responsible.

101
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:08,704
Let me slap some sense back into you.
Come here.

102
00:07:08,788 --> 00:07:10,706
Whoa! I don't care how much I like you.

103
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,541
I'm not getting slapped again.

104
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:16,754
Listen carefully.

105
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:20,758
In four days, after you go back to Earth,

106
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:23,177
I'm never going to see you again. The end.

107
00:07:25,596 --> 00:07:27,348
You know how strong alcohol is up here?

108
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:29,308
But you drank it anyway, and then, this.

109
00:07:29,392 --> 00:07:31,227
You break into the commander's room,

110
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,771
and then go and hit on the commander.

111
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:38,609
This is unacceptable.

112
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:41,320
I'm reporting this
to IOU Mission Control immediately.

113
00:07:41,987 --> 00:07:42,863
Be prepared.

114
00:07:42,947 --> 00:07:44,281
Go ahead, report it.

115
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:49,120
Then the whole world will find out
that the tourist likes the commander.

116
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:57,712
What will the crew think of me
if they find out about this?

117
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:02,466
"She's getting involved with a tourist
who's only here for a few days?"

118
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:07,888
The idea of me getting tangled up
with the fiancé of a wealthy heiress

119
00:08:07,972 --> 00:08:09,223
is utterly mortifying.

120
00:08:09,306 --> 00:08:10,558
It's appalling.

121
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:19,275
I'm going back to being a doctor

122
00:08:19,358 --> 00:08:20,985
and cutting ties with MZ Group.

123
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,865
I'm not comfortable being part of MZ.
Plus, it doesn't suit me.

124
00:08:25,948 --> 00:08:28,200
I'm just a tourist
who's here for a few days,

125
00:08:28,284 --> 00:08:31,370
so I get why it would be hard
for you to open up to me.

126
00:08:31,454 --> 00:08:32,455
Plus, you're taken.

127
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:34,749
So, of course, right now it's impossible.

128
00:08:34,832 --> 00:08:35,916
But,

129
00:08:38,878 --> 00:08:42,047
a year from now,
if you find yourself alone,

130
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,592
think of me.

131
00:08:46,927 --> 00:08:49,513
If you're with someone better than me,
then keep him.

132
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:51,849
But if I get lucky and you're stuck

133
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:54,101
with a bunch of losers, then…

134
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:59,023
maybe we can date.

135
00:09:00,065 --> 00:09:01,400
I'll wait.

136
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:16,582
Don't do that either.

137
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,793
Who says you get to wait?

138
00:09:18,876 --> 00:09:19,919
No thanks.

139
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:24,340
You absolutely cannot have
feelings for me.

140
00:09:25,257 --> 00:09:26,759
This is an order.

141
00:09:26,842 --> 00:09:29,678
"You absolutely cannot have
feelings for me."

142
00:09:29,762 --> 00:09:31,555
Does an order like that exist in space?

143
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,767
You're not even in the same league
as the guys I know.

144
00:09:35,559 --> 00:09:37,436
Am I so unattractive?

145
00:09:39,063 --> 00:09:40,689
-That's correct.
-In what way?

146
00:09:40,773 --> 00:09:42,066
-In every way.
-Every way?

147
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:43,400
Yes, in every way.

148
00:09:55,788 --> 00:09:56,664
Fine.

149
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,793
I got it.

150
00:10:00,876 --> 00:10:03,045
You don't look like you get it.

151
00:10:03,128 --> 00:10:04,588
I'm not an idiot.

152
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:10,845
Get some rest.

153
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:15,474
Where did you get the alcohol?

154
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:19,770
-From the observation module?
-No.

155
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:21,480
-Did Santi give it to you?
-No.

156
00:10:25,401 --> 00:10:27,278
After I report this to MCC,

157
00:10:27,945 --> 00:10:29,989
I'm going to find the booze
and the culprit.

158
00:10:30,072 --> 00:10:31,198
Understood?

159
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:32,116
No.

160
00:10:57,349 --> 00:10:58,350
Santi!

161
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:01,604
Santi!

162
00:11:05,608 --> 00:11:06,984
I'm so sorry.

163
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:10,988
You guys almost got caught
because of me. Sorry.

164
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,698
Oh, you mean the drinks?

165
00:11:13,991 --> 00:11:15,993
I'm an expert at not getting caught.

166
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:26,712
Where is the drink?

167
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,513
Ta-da.

168
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:40,309
We don't have any experiments
going on right now.

169
00:11:40,392 --> 00:11:43,437
So, nothing to cultivate,
and they keep it shut down.

170
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,981
Isn't this an incubator?

171
00:11:46,065 --> 00:11:50,027
It is an alcohol storage for now.

172
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:53,864
Maybe other astronauts can use it.

173
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:55,866
Nah, why would they?

174
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,202
They probably forgot
I have this over here.

175
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,371
They have the same exact machines
on that side as on this side,

176
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:02,247
but those are way newer.

177
00:12:02,331 --> 00:12:04,833
They would never come over here
to use the ones on this side.

178
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:06,335
Santi?

179
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:09,630
This bottle…

180
00:12:10,506 --> 00:12:12,508
Let's hide it in a safer place.

181
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,176
A safer place?

182
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:15,094
Yes.

183
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,640
The commander first suspected you.

184
00:12:19,723 --> 00:12:22,309
How about we hide it somewhere else?

185
00:12:22,393 --> 00:12:26,397
Not the observation module
where you sleep, right?

186
00:12:28,273 --> 00:12:29,817
Do you get what I'm saying?

187
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:33,862
I got you.

188
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,748
{\an8}SEOUL, 4:27 A.M. ILS 7:27 P.M.

189
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:48,335
Change the water
and go to sleep, Seung-jun.

190
00:12:49,503 --> 00:12:52,715
ILS needs to sleep so we can go home.

191
00:12:52,798 --> 00:12:54,258
Please, let us get some rest.

192
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,260
Okay.

193
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:59,596
<i>I think I saw mold growing</i>
<i>on the Japanese mustard greens.</i>

194
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,807
Can you ask Mina to check it?
I can't reach her.

195
00:13:02,391 --> 00:13:04,351
She's probably sleeping
because she's tired.

196
00:13:04,435 --> 00:13:05,728
But it'll probably spread.

197
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:14,778
<i>You won't be satisfied</i>
<i>until you wake her up, will you, Si-won?</i>

198
00:13:15,654 --> 00:13:16,989
<i>Yup.</i>

199
00:13:18,282 --> 00:13:21,201
But how?

200
00:13:21,285 --> 00:13:22,953
He saw it for a split second.

201
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:25,664
How did Mr. Gong know
that was Kang Kang-su's ticket?

202
00:13:25,748 --> 00:13:30,002
The same thing is written
on a picture in Dr. Kang's bedroom.

203
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:32,463
"Stand by me"?

204
00:13:32,546 --> 00:13:34,339
Oh, my God.

205
00:13:34,423 --> 00:13:36,717
Do you know
how embarrassed I was as an astronaut

206
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,720
to be caught
like that in front of a tourist?

207
00:13:39,803 --> 00:13:43,891
I want to crawl into the butthole
of one of Dr. Kang's fruit flies and hide.

208
00:13:43,974 --> 00:13:47,936
First of all, calm down.

209
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,314
Calm down.

210
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:53,984
He told me I could keep it
and that he wouldn't tell Dr. Kang.

211
00:13:54,068 --> 00:13:55,736
But how can I believe him, Dona?

212
00:13:56,862 --> 00:14:00,240
On top of that,
he wants me to do him a favor.

213
00:14:00,324 --> 00:14:04,620
He's letting me have 500 billion.
Just imagine what he'll ask for in return!

214
00:14:04,703 --> 00:14:07,623
Well, it's not like
he would ask you to kill someone.

215
00:14:07,706 --> 00:14:10,542
Just do whatever he asks!

216
00:14:10,626 --> 00:14:14,088
I've only known him for four days.

217
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:18,675
He just went outside
without a spacewalk suit on

218
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:21,595
and jumped into space. He's nuts.

219
00:14:21,678 --> 00:14:25,224
How am I supposed to know
what a lunatic like that is going to ask?

220
00:14:26,892 --> 00:14:27,976
Damn it.

221
00:14:28,727 --> 00:14:33,482
Dona, I'm so scared. I feel like Dr. Kang
is going to come for me any second.

222
00:14:33,565 --> 00:14:35,317
I'm so anxious that I can't breathe.

223
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,528
Screw the 500 billion won,

224
00:14:37,611 --> 00:14:39,905
even if you gave me a trillion won,
I can't.

225
00:14:39,988 --> 00:14:43,909
I'm just going to give back
the lottery ticket.

226
00:14:43,992 --> 00:14:45,035
Hey.

227
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:48,038
Wait. Hang on, Mina!

228
00:14:48,122 --> 00:14:50,332
Mina, wait a minute. Mina!

229
00:14:50,415 --> 00:14:54,002
So let's say we keep it.

230
00:14:54,628 --> 00:14:58,423
We only have a month
to claim the winnings, right?

231
00:14:58,507 --> 00:15:02,970
I'm not on the manifest to go back on
the G.O-10 when it leaves in a few days.

232
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:06,640
Only Santi, Kang Kang-su, and Gong Ryong
are scheduled to go back down.

233
00:15:06,723 --> 00:15:08,142
How do we claim this money?

234
00:15:08,225 --> 00:15:12,271
I'll alter your chart to show
that your hormones are out of whack.

235
00:15:12,354 --> 00:15:14,606
They'll have to send you back first,

236
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:15,858
and I'll make it happen.

237
00:15:15,941 --> 00:15:17,401
Are you out of your mind?

238
00:15:18,152 --> 00:15:19,361
<i>Aren't you a doctor?</i>

239
00:15:19,444 --> 00:15:25,325
If we get caught,
we're both finished in this industry.

240
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:28,704
Dona, the money
is getting to your head. Oh, God.

241
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,503
Forget it.
There's no way we can claim this money.

242
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,551
I'm going to give it back.

243
00:15:43,135 --> 00:15:44,219
Bye.

244
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:47,222
Hey, wait.

245
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,141
Mina!

246
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:49,743
Where the hell is it?

247
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,381
Dr. Kang, I have something to tell you.

248
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:43,855
Dr. Lee!

249
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:54,032
What are you two doing up
instead of sleeping?

250
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,909
Do you have a new pair of micro scissors?

251
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:57,619
Why?

252
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,871
Can't you just lend them to me?

253
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,540
Why do you always have to ask why?

254
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:04,208
I don't have any.

255
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,336
If you don't have any, then why ask why?

256
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:12,383
Dr. Kang, I have something to tell you.

257
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:13,760
Again with the gloves.

258
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:16,930
When you touch moldy greens,
they get covered in spores.

259
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:20,099
How many times have I told you
to use them once and discard them?

260
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,852
What if those spores
contaminate my fruit flies?

261
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:25,897
Proper disposal of gloves after use
is essential for scientists.

262
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:29,776
Why would you carry those around?
How much money do you think you're saving?

263
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:30,902
And my micro scissors.

264
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,696
You used them on your tomatoes,
and now they're damaged.

265
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,492
They don't work with precision anymore,
so I end up doing my work twice.

266
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:41,496
I didn't damage your scissors.

267
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:44,248
Did you think I wouldn't notice
if they were off by 0.00001 mm?

268
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:48,169
They've only been like that
since you used them.

269
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,422
I sterilized the gloves and--

270
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:52,674
What did you want to say?

271
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:57,929
Who the hell put this mouse food here?

272
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,764
Those damn mice eat like pigs.

273
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,015
Hey.

274
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,351
What were you going to say?

275
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,230
What?

276
00:19:08,022 --> 00:19:10,858
Want me to buy you more gloves?
They cost nothing.

277
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,319
I'll get you an unlimited supply,

278
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:15,989
so how about we stop nagging about money?

279
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:17,907
You're a scientist. Gloves, seriously?

280
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:21,202
Were you born a jerk, Dr. Kang?

281
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:22,495
What did you say?

282
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,748
What, so a scientist asks, "Why?"
Is that such a bad thing?

283
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:29,419
Isn't "why" the word
that should be most frequently used

284
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,337
by a scientist?

285
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:33,756
Why are you bragging about being rich?

286
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,216
For the love of God, why?

287
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:37,176
Come on. Why are you two being like this?

288
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,262
That's what you wanted to tell me?

289
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,805
Yes!

290
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,306
No!

291
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,856
Yes!

292
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,822
Don't throw them in there.

293
00:19:57,905 --> 00:20:00,616
The spores could fly around
and kill my fruit flies.

294
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,326
I told you, I sterilized them!

295
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,661
Dispose of them in your lab.

296
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:06,664
This trash bin is for public use.

297
00:20:06,748 --> 00:20:09,208
I don't care how much money you have.

298
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:11,335
This trash bin doesn't belong to you.

299
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:13,713
It's for the whole planet, got it?

300
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:17,258
Even if I were drowning in debt,

301
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,634
this trash bin would be

302
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:23,848
public property for everyone on Earth,
including me, okay?

303
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,942
She's so damn loud.

304
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:38,237
KOREA SPACE AGENCY

305
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,533
<i>Why is my hand tingling?</i>

306
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,701
It feels like it's going numb.

307
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,329
-Tae-hui.
-Yeah?

308
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,915
Can I have this watch someday?

309
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,083
Why?

310
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,669
Isn't this supposed to be passed down
to the best student?

311
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:38,422
I'll wear it for a bit,
then pass it down to her.

312
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,592
Let go of my hand already.

313
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:43,803
You're so bossy.

314
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,888
Eve, what did you eat today?

315
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,974
What? I…

316
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:51,435
I… Well…

317
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,355
I don't remember.

318
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,565
What?

319
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:58,234
You don't remember
your last meal on Earth?

320
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,653
My mind is blank, Commander.

321
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,365
That's totally normal.

322
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,075
That's how I was on my first flight.

323
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,997
Eve, you worked really hard to get here.

324
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,665
Today, just sit back and enjoy.

325
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,252
Yes, Commander.

326
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,424
Here, take a look.

327
00:22:22,383 --> 00:22:24,927
That space suit really suits you.

328
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:30,266
Beautiful, right? Don't you think?

329
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,226
Dong-a, please.

330
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:35,897
See? I mean it.

331
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,445
That idiot doesn't deserve this.

332
00:23:38,292 --> 00:23:40,044
I thought you were going to call Eve.

333
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:42,129
She's not answering. Must be asleep.

334
00:23:46,175 --> 00:23:47,927
When will you be done with the handover?

335
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:51,138
At this rate,
you'll be coming in every day.

336
00:23:51,222 --> 00:23:53,307
I've been here for over three years.

337
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,352
I need time to say goodbye.

338
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:16,580
I really hate that you're leaving.

339
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:43,899
Hi, Ryong.

340
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:46,694
-Go-eun.
-<i>I'm sorry.</i>

341
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:49,155
I announced our engagement
without talking to you.

342
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,489
<i>It must've been a shock.</i>

343
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,367
I'm sorry.

344
00:24:57,747 --> 00:24:58,831
I'm a lousy guy.

345
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,624
<i>Why would you say that?</i>

346
00:25:00,708 --> 00:25:02,376
You're doing a great job.

347
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,088
<i>You managed to do the surgery,</i>
<i>and you're doing so well, so why?</i>

348
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:11,010
I'm the one who's sorry
Kang Kang-su stepped in and took over.

349
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,304
I'm too embarrassed to face you.

350
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:14,722
So, why would you say that?

351
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:17,850
I…

352
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,687
I'm not good enough for you.

353
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:23,522
That's not true.

354
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:27,568
It's not because of Kang Kang-su,
it's because of me.

355
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:33,115
I…

356
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,078
am not getting engaged to you.

357
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,458
I'm sorry.

358
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:47,129
I'm really sorry.

359
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:26,710
FLAVORS OF THE MOUNTAIN, SEA, AND SKY

360
00:26:26,794 --> 00:26:28,838
CLOSED FOR LUNCH TODAY

361
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:44,061
I can't do a good reading if I'm hungry.

362
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,188
Wait.

363
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,323
Have some water.

364
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,619
Unlucky, really unlucky.

365
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:03,706
This guy is really unlucky.

366
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,333
Is he really your son?

367
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,376
-Yes.
-Yes.

368
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:16,051
He is like a solitary pine tree

369
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,262
standing alone on a rock.

370
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:20,973
He has no luck with parents,

371
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,267
no luck with money,

372
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,019
and no luck with his career.

373
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:28,314
Forget that. Does he have luck with women?

374
00:27:30,107 --> 00:27:31,525
You cut this out.

375
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,490
How did he meet someone like her?

376
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:41,827
Her lineage has brought her great fortune.

377
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:44,496
She has it all.

378
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,626
Wow, her face
has money written all over it.

379
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:54,924
Of all the faces I've seen,
hers is the most auspicious.

380
00:27:56,926 --> 00:28:00,221
Okay, so her face is auspicious.

381
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:03,307
Are you saying they don't suit each other?

382
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,475
No.

383
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,393
They'll have a happy marriage.

384
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:09,647
He marries her,
and everything she has becomes his.

385
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:11,815
A match made in heaven.

386
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,109
A match that happens
once in a thousand years.

387
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,615
-Wow, a thousand years.
-It all becomes his.

388
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:20,741
Forget a hundred.

389
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:24,828
So what you're saying is,
they don't suit each other,

390
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,580
but they'll be happily married?

391
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:30,584
Are you saying our son will be respected
and get to call the shots?

392
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:32,503
He's already calling the shots.

393
00:28:32,586 --> 00:28:33,963
She's more into him.

394
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,551
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

395
00:28:42,596 --> 00:28:43,973
So, which of you is his mom?

396
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:48,978
You're the fortune teller. Take a guess.

397
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,782
That's easy.
Only one of you has had a baby.

398
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,708
Did you get through to the space station?

399
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:16,422
<i>I'm not good enough for you.</i>

400
00:29:17,506 --> 00:29:18,424
I…

401
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:22,428
am not getting engaged to you.

402
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,891
What do you want to eat?

403
00:29:58,255 --> 00:29:59,423
You go first.

404
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:00,883
Get in.

405
00:30:23,364 --> 00:30:24,239
What floor?

406
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,329
You need to press the button.

407
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,499
Are you expecting me to press it?

408
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,793
I said, what floor?

409
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:48,681
I made a mistake yesterday. I'm sorry.

410
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:52,810
Ryong and I will spend the rest
of our lives trying to make it up to you.

411
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:54,269
Ryong feels the same way.

412
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:57,564
You liked Kang-su too.

413
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:00,984
You liked him, but now you hate his guts.

414
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:03,737
Over time, you'll hate Ryong too.

415
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:07,574
Ryong doesn't like you
as much as you like him.

416
00:31:08,951 --> 00:31:10,703
-I know.
-You do?

417
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:12,621
What's wrong with you?

418
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:15,499
What could you possibly lack?
Are you missing a nostril?

419
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,126
Are you missing an eye?

420
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:20,546
Why isn't the daughter of Choi Jae-ryong
being showered with love?

421
00:31:20,629 --> 00:31:22,089
Why is she clinging to a man?

422
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:25,509
You think I like Kang-su
because of his deep pockets?

423
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:28,637
It's because his feelings for you

424
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:31,932
are much deeper than Ryong's.

425
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:39,898
Kang-su stole the eggs and sperm
to bring Ryong down.

426
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:43,485
He's trying to show off,
but he's got nothing to show.

427
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,112
He's never going to pull it off.

428
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:57,416
-One last breath. Can the father help too?
-Yes.

429
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:58,751
Last one, breathe.

430
00:31:58,834 --> 00:31:59,668
Breathe.

431
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,755
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

432
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,632
You're parents now.

433
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:08,677
Dr. Jeon.

434
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:12,014
Have you heard from Dr. Gong?
Is everything okay?

435
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:15,058
Oh, I meant to get in touch with you.

436
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,686
I had a lot of deliveries scheduled.

437
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:24,735
Ryong is fine,
and he successfully retrieved the eggs.

438
00:32:28,822 --> 00:32:30,824
He pulled it off
without anyone catching on.

439
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:33,952
Then Dr. Gong
can work on the procedure too.

440
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:36,038
What a relief.

441
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,539
Have you had lunch?

442
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:41,627
I knew it, you haven't eaten again.
Let's grab lunch.

443
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:45,005
Ryong almost died trying to get them back.

444
00:32:45,088 --> 00:32:47,424
He risked his life,
so you need to eat properly.

445
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,177
You're right. Let's go.

446
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:57,643
I hope Ryong succeeds
and brings Kang Kang-su down a peg.

447
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,561
I trust Dr. Gong.

448
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,188
I know he'll get the job done.

449
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:07,152
I need you to come with me.
Chairman Choi is asking for you.

450
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:12,115
RESTRICTED AREA

451
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:15,077
For it to be a pregnancy,
the fertilized egg must look like this.

452
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,996
I got a message saying that

453
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,124
six of the seven eggs
Dr. Kang worked on were fertilized.

454
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,711
Six of them are pregnancies?

455
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:25,796
Yes, sir.

456
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:29,007
We've never had a successful
fertilization here. Congratulations.

457
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:33,303
If the last one fertilizes too,
won't that make seven?

458
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,307
Kang-su's the man.

459
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:39,226
I knew he could pull it off.

460
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:43,856
See, Go-eun?
I told you Kang-su could do it.

461
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,235
Ryong couldn't do it
even after multiple attempts,

462
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:49,987
but Kang-su did it on his first try.

463
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,780
Do you still think you're right?

464
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:57,870
Hey, send me pictures of my grandchildren.

465
00:33:57,953 --> 00:33:58,912
Pardon?

466
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:02,499
Forget those pictures
of other people's fertilized eggs.

467
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:07,838
I want pictures of my grandchildren.
The ones my son and my daughter-in-law

468
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:09,298
are going to have.

469
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:12,134
Oh, right.
I'll pass the request along to Dr. Kang.

470
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:17,139
Now, we freeze them,
ship them back to Earth,

471
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:22,060
and then implant them
in my daughter-in-law, correct?

472
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:26,899
So, it's all finished now, isn't it?
We're done, right?

473
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:30,986
How do you feel, Min-jeong?

474
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:35,115
Given that you were upset with me
for changing your primary doctor

475
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,783
without your consent,

476
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:39,578
I'm going to ask for your approval
in front of everyone.

477
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,496
You said you were the mother, right?

478
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,165
You said you were in charge?

479
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,459
You said you'd make the decisions?

480
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:48,337
So, what do you say?
Should we tell Kang-su to stop?

481
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:51,506
You decide.

482
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:54,051
Are you going to reject
what Kang-su has achieved?

483
00:34:55,385 --> 00:34:56,553
Answer me.

484
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,476
If you say you want to continue, we will.

485
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,645
Otherwise, I'll tell him to stop.

486
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:08,482
Should we continue?

487
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:17,157
Have they developed into morulas?

488
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,451
Min-jeong.

489
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:22,204
Morulas?

490
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:26,083
Once a fertilized egg
has divided into 16 cells,

491
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,085
it is then called a morula.

492
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:30,671
At this stage,
it can implant in the uterus.

493
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:32,005
When does that happen?

494
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:34,466
It could happen as early as tonight.

495
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,307
What do you want to do?

496
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,519
Still going to insist on Ryong?

497
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,313
Should we turn off the incubator?

498
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:05,539
Thank you.

499
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,750
Father.

500
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:15,549
It's done.

501
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,802
Go-eun, it's over.

502
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,473
What time is it there? Isn't it morning?

503
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,607
{\an8}GONG RYONG'S 5TH DAY

504
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:05,515
You're really not going to say anything?

505
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,226
You're not going to ask
to split the money or anything?

506
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:11,188
That's right.

507
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,484
You said, "No questions asked."

508
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:19,154
What is it you need my help with?

509
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:23,241
You don't want me to ask
or question you about it,

510
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:24,534
and just do as you say.

511
00:37:24,618 --> 00:37:25,702
What on earth is it?

512
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,790
What, do you really
want me to kill someone?

513
00:37:35,796 --> 00:37:36,713
I can't do it.

514
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:39,508
I'm going to turn myself in to Dr. Kang.

515
00:37:41,093 --> 00:37:42,094
It's the opposite.

516
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:47,057
I want you to save someone,
the same way we saved that mouse.

517
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:52,145
Tell me what it is right now.

518
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,941
It's simple.

519
00:37:56,858 --> 00:38:00,445
All you have to do is hold my legs.

520
00:38:08,662 --> 00:38:09,746
What?

521
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,249
{\an8}<i>Sueños húmedos,</i>

522
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,502
{\an8}<i>cabalgata caliente…</i>

523
00:38:19,965 --> 00:38:22,926
Dirty confessions.

524
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,387
Morning.

525
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,725
Yeah.

526
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,018
That sucks

527
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,149
having to do this every day,
every morning.

528
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:40,277
Yeah, I'm sick of it too, man.

529
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,779
I…

530
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:44,739
I miss my wife.

531
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:49,327
I miss my home.

532
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,835
You said you wanted to get
a new house, right?

533
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,173
Yeah. I mean, I want to.

534
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:05,427
Then you will need

535
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:08,597
money, right?

536
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:12,601
Yeah.

537
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:13,643
Yeah?

538
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,272
Okay.

539
00:39:55,393 --> 00:40:01,066
KING OF MONEY

540
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,953
How's Male Mouse 1's mate
back on Earth doing?

541
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,164
His mate

542
00:40:16,248 --> 00:40:19,834
is eating, sleeping, and playing well.
She's doing great.

543
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,879
Her coat shines.
She's also chubby and pretty.

544
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:25,882
Male Mouse 1
had the best appetite and libido

545
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:28,385
<i>of any mouse on Earth.</i>

546
00:40:28,468 --> 00:40:30,929
He had the strongest sperm.
He was truly exceptional.

547
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,847
That's why he went to space.

548
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:37,811
I have no idea how he'll ever recover.

549
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,022
Where's Chief Kang?

550
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:42,816
She's not in yet.

551
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,067
Really?

552
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,124
Who could be calling?

553
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:07,590
{\an8}<i>I wonder who it is.</i>

554
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:10,427
<i>Maybe it's something urgent.</i>

555
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,845
<i>Looks like they hung up.</i>

556
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:18,852
<i>Dong-a, hang on a second.</i>

557
00:41:20,103 --> 00:41:21,896
<i>You can call them later.</i>

558
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,733
<i>That tickles!</i>

559
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:27,277
Stop it. Hang on. Time out.

560
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:36,911
I heard rumors that you were into Eve.

561
00:41:36,995 --> 00:41:37,829
Did I hear wrong?

562
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:42,167
It's true?

563
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,086
No.

564
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:51,384
<i>I don't think Eve is interested in men.</i>

565
00:41:51,468 --> 00:41:53,136
She doesn't seem to be dating anyone.

566
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,183
Applying to go away
for a year says it all.

567
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:03,563
Eve doesn't know much about men.

568
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:12,322
Cut it out.

569
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:16,701
Aren't you going to go to work?
Stop it, come on.

570
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,788
Come on, stop.

571
00:43:20,147 --> 00:43:22,399
Where's the bottle of liquor?
Where did you hide it?

572
00:43:23,859 --> 00:43:24,693
I don't know.

573
00:43:27,154 --> 00:43:28,656
You're always lying.

574
00:43:30,532 --> 00:43:33,577
Why do all men do that?

575
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:35,913
I have nothing more to say.

576
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:40,417
This liar is going to leave now.

577
00:43:40,501 --> 00:43:42,127
They're worse than animals.

578
00:43:43,712 --> 00:43:46,465
Men who betray women are absolute trash.

579
00:43:47,675 --> 00:43:49,343
They're foul and repulsive.

580
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:52,221
They make me sick to my stomach.

581
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:53,931
What?

582
00:43:54,014 --> 00:43:56,183
We've been here for how long?

583
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:58,310
When their partner is out of sight,

584
00:43:58,394 --> 00:44:01,105
do men just toss aside
their faith, loyalty, and trust?

585
00:44:01,188 --> 00:44:03,649
Are they just mammals
that throw everything away

586
00:44:04,483 --> 00:44:06,360
when they take off their pants?

587
00:44:07,194 --> 00:44:09,738
Do men just like any woman they meet?

588
00:44:10,447 --> 00:44:12,032
Please stop.

589
00:44:13,033 --> 00:44:15,661
I get it, okay?

590
00:44:15,744 --> 00:44:17,579
Turning me down is one thing,

591
00:44:17,663 --> 00:44:19,623
but aren't you being a little harsh?

592
00:44:19,707 --> 00:44:22,501
Do you actually want to see me
die of embarrassment?

593
00:44:22,584 --> 00:44:25,337
Should I show you how
to die in space from humiliation?

594
00:44:26,588 --> 00:44:28,590
Being classified as a mammal alongside men

595
00:44:28,674 --> 00:44:30,926
is absolutely mortifying for me.

596
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:32,636
That's all.

597
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,723
Yes, I am a mammal!

598
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:39,727
What?

599
00:44:41,937 --> 00:44:43,272
What?

600
00:44:49,069 --> 00:44:50,612
CHIEF KANG TAE-HUI

601
00:45:00,205 --> 00:45:01,540
Seriously…

602
00:45:40,329 --> 00:45:41,330
Hi.

603
00:45:41,413 --> 00:45:43,540
<i>Hey, you called.</i>

604
00:45:43,624 --> 00:45:44,708
<i>What's up?</i>

605
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,837
Is something wrong? Why did you call?

606
00:45:57,638 --> 00:45:59,098
<i>I think there's booze onboard.</i>

607
00:45:59,181 --> 00:46:00,390
At the space station?

608
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:01,934
Who's the culprit?

609
00:46:02,017 --> 00:46:05,145
<i>Do you think Mr. Gong took it up there?</i>

610
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:06,105
<i>Is it soju?</i>

611
00:46:06,188 --> 00:46:07,648
<i>Whisky? Cognac?</i>

612
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,067
Lee Seung-jun…

613
00:46:10,776 --> 00:46:11,652
It's Santi, right?

614
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:14,696
I haven't found the bottle.
They're denying it.

615
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,658
When I wanted
to install a camera in every module,

616
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:20,619
they complained about their human rights.
Now I know why.

617
00:46:20,702 --> 00:46:23,539
<i>Do whatever it takes</i>
<i>to find evidence, okay?</i>

618
00:46:23,622 --> 00:46:26,708
<i>If you can't control them from the start,</i>
<i>the entire year will be hell.</i>

619
00:46:26,792 --> 00:46:28,544
<i>If they conduct experiments in secret,</i>

620
00:46:28,627 --> 00:46:30,796
disobey orders,
shift the blame onto others,

621
00:46:30,879 --> 00:46:33,757
and ignore the manual,
it will quickly become chaos.

622
00:46:35,134 --> 00:46:37,261
<i>Let me tell you,</i>
<i>when I first took command,</i>

623
00:46:37,344 --> 00:46:39,596
<i>I caught someone drinking alcohol</i>
<i>they had hidden.</i>

624
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:41,974
Sometimes, the experienced ones

625
00:46:42,057 --> 00:46:44,601
think they have the right
to overstep boundaries.

626
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:47,938
<i>In cases like that, don't hesitate.</i>
<i>Report it immediately.</i>

627
00:46:48,021 --> 00:46:50,065
After they were disciplined,
had their pay cut,

628
00:46:50,149 --> 00:46:53,652
<i>and were passed over for promotions,</i>
<i>they fell in line real quick.</i>

629
00:46:53,735 --> 00:46:56,280
<i>After that,</i>
<i>being commander was a piece of cake.</i>

630
00:46:58,657 --> 00:46:59,825
Right.

631
00:46:59,908 --> 00:47:02,035
They obviously hid it
in the observation module.

632
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:03,537
Search every inch of it.

633
00:47:04,621 --> 00:47:05,622
I will.

634
00:47:24,224 --> 00:47:26,435
What? Mammal?

635
00:47:27,644 --> 00:47:28,687
What was that about?

636
00:47:54,838 --> 00:47:57,799
DR. NA MIN-JEONG

637
00:47:58,800 --> 00:47:59,885
Hi, Dr. Na.

638
00:48:00,886 --> 00:48:03,555
<i>I have the eggs and sperm,</i>
<i>and I found an incubator.</i>

639
00:48:04,139 --> 00:48:07,476
If I work on it tonight, they should be
morulas by the time I leave.

640
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:10,062
Don't worry.
You just take care of your health.

641
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:12,356
<i>Don't do it.</i>

642
00:48:13,273 --> 00:48:14,107
What?

643
00:48:14,942 --> 00:48:16,902
Dr. Kang Kang-su can take over.

644
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:21,531
What are you talking about?

645
00:48:22,407 --> 00:48:24,159
I changed my mind.

646
00:48:24,243 --> 00:48:26,119
If you get caught, you'll be in danger.

647
00:48:27,079 --> 00:48:30,082
Don't worry about me. I can get this done.

648
00:48:30,165 --> 00:48:31,416
<i>If you get caught,</i>

649
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:33,919
it could jeopardize Dr. Kang's work.

650
00:48:36,088 --> 00:48:37,130
<i>I've got to go.</i>

651
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:39,925
Wait, Dr. Na?

652
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:56,858
{\an8}DR. GONG RYONG

653
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:06,410
{\an8}MISSED CALL

654
00:49:16,169 --> 00:49:17,587
I want to go home.

655
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:15,896
Yes!

656
00:50:28,325 --> 00:50:29,701
{\an8}KANG KANG-SU

657
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:33,205
Hey, Kang-su.

658
00:50:33,288 --> 00:50:35,457
Sir, this is going to make you happy.

659
00:50:36,416 --> 00:50:38,085
All seven of them

660
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:41,171
have undergone cell division
and developed into morulas.

661
00:50:41,254 --> 00:50:42,964
<i>They are ready to be implanted.</i>

662
00:50:44,383 --> 00:50:45,550
It's done.

663
00:50:45,634 --> 00:50:48,345
Now we just have to freeze them
and take them back to Earth.

664
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:50,430
Congratulations, sir.

665
00:50:52,724 --> 00:50:53,809
Lee!

666
00:50:55,268 --> 00:50:56,603
Yes, sir.

667
00:50:57,354 --> 00:51:01,149
I want you to take a picture
of my grandchildren right now.

668
00:51:01,233 --> 00:51:04,486
Take their picture
and send them to me immediately.

669
00:51:04,569 --> 00:51:05,487
I'm sorry?

670
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:09,408
I have to be the first
to see my grandchildren.

671
00:51:09,491 --> 00:51:11,118
Do it right now!

672
00:51:12,035 --> 00:51:14,704
We did it. It's done.

673
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:17,791
Yes, sir. Please give me a second.

674
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:21,628
From one to seven,
don't leave a single one out.

675
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:22,838
Do it now!

676
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:26,925
-Gather everyone.
-Yes, sir.

677
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,139
-Sir.
-Chairman Choi, you're here.

678
00:51:34,641 --> 00:51:36,184
Who wants some fried chicken?

679
00:53:11,738 --> 00:53:13,073
The first one…

680
00:53:16,201 --> 00:53:17,035
A son.

681
00:53:29,381 --> 00:53:30,465
The second…

682
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:33,051
A daughter.

683
00:53:40,058 --> 00:53:41,643
Where is Santi?

684
00:53:42,561 --> 00:53:44,145
Is he in the observation module?

685
00:53:45,188 --> 00:53:46,398
He's not there.

686
00:53:48,149 --> 00:53:49,859
Then he's in the observation module.

687
00:53:49,943 --> 00:53:51,987
You lie every time you open your mouth.

688
00:53:54,281 --> 00:53:56,533
I told you, I drank it by myself.

689
00:53:58,702 --> 00:54:01,496
He should be collecting
a sample right about now.

690
00:54:02,455 --> 00:54:04,082
Let's see if I'm right.

691
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:15,552
The sixth is a daughter.

692
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,351
And the youngest is a son.

693
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,354
Santi!

694
00:54:27,439 --> 00:54:28,273
Commander.

695
00:54:29,774 --> 00:54:30,609
Santi.

696
00:54:30,692 --> 00:54:34,863
Commander, I'm the only one
you need to punish.

697
00:54:34,946 --> 00:54:36,615
Santi doesn't know anything, I swear.

698
00:54:37,449 --> 00:54:38,408
He's done already?

699
00:54:41,536 --> 00:54:42,704
Where is he?

700
00:54:44,122 --> 00:54:45,582
Come on, Commander.

701
00:54:47,125 --> 00:54:49,127
Sir, I finished taking their pictures.

702
00:54:49,210 --> 00:54:52,797
I'm sending you pictures of all seven
of your grandchildren right now.

703
00:55:02,891 --> 00:55:03,933
I did it.

704
00:55:04,934 --> 00:55:08,855
I told you, Santi has no idea.
He's innocent.

705
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:10,899
Stop lying, and stop following me.

706
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:13,360
Is Santi here?

707
00:55:14,986 --> 00:55:16,029
Santi? Why?

708
00:55:16,655 --> 00:55:18,448
Dr. Kang, are you hiding Santi here?

709
00:55:21,284 --> 00:55:22,786
Dr. Kang.

710
00:55:22,869 --> 00:55:25,288
I think they were drinking together.

711
00:55:26,373 --> 00:55:27,499
Wait.

712
00:55:28,083 --> 00:55:29,417
These are the wrong settings.

713
00:55:29,501 --> 00:55:32,837
It's set to 37 degrees, 5% oxygen.

714
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:37,425
Won't the fruit flies die from the heat?

715
00:55:41,262 --> 00:55:42,514
I'm doing a cell comparison.

716
00:55:43,098 --> 00:55:46,685
I'm simultaneously investigating
both damaged human genes

717
00:55:46,768 --> 00:55:48,395
and aging fruit fly genes.

718
00:55:49,187 --> 00:55:53,817
Wait, didn't we agree
to share that information last time?

719
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,819
Why are you looking for Santi here?

720
00:55:56,361 --> 00:55:57,654
Isn't this…

721
00:56:05,912 --> 00:56:08,289
What is that picture?

722
00:56:14,295 --> 00:56:16,005
Isn't it obvious?

723
00:56:17,048 --> 00:56:20,093
It's an image of a fruit fly embryo
undergoing cell division.

724
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:23,847
The scale indicates
a measurement of 0.2 mm.

725
00:56:23,930 --> 00:56:27,183
At 0.2 mm,
that's more the size of a human embryo…

726
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:44,701
Is that a morula?

727
00:56:50,665 --> 00:56:51,708
A morula?

728
00:56:52,917 --> 00:56:54,878
-Why is there a morula--
-Commander.

729
00:57:14,522 --> 00:57:16,608
Did you fertilize that here?

730
00:57:17,609 --> 00:57:20,236
You've been lying to us,
pretending to work on fruit flies.

731
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,615
You set the incubator
to 37 degrees and 5% oxygen

732
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:26,201
to culture human cells?

733
00:57:30,538 --> 00:57:32,332
Commander, wait a minute, that--

734
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,333
Let go of me.

735
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:34,876
Dr. Kang.

736
00:57:36,503 --> 00:57:39,881
Until now, no human egg
has ever been sent into space.

737
00:57:40,507 --> 00:57:42,092
Because it's forbidden.

738
00:57:42,801 --> 00:57:45,595
It's wrong to experiment
on humans, correct?

739
00:57:46,721 --> 00:57:49,557
You of all people know
what we do to mice and fruit flies.

740
00:57:49,641 --> 00:57:51,768
How could you do this
with human sperm and eggs…

741
00:57:51,851 --> 00:57:54,062
You know it's against space law,

742
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:57,524
so how could you perform an ICSI?

743
00:57:59,234 --> 00:58:00,610
Dr. Kang, have you lost it?

744
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:04,781
Do you think this is no different
from our countless other experiments?

745
00:58:06,366 --> 00:58:08,284
You know why this is banned.

746
00:58:09,494 --> 00:58:11,037
How could you even think about

747
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:14,165
creating a human being at a space station?

748
00:58:14,249 --> 00:58:15,708
Eve, calm down.

749
00:58:18,628 --> 00:58:19,921
Open that door.

750
00:58:24,717 --> 00:58:25,969
Are you crazy?

751
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:28,555
Open it now.

752
00:58:29,264 --> 00:58:31,558
Open the incubator door this instant.

753
00:58:34,227 --> 00:58:36,938
Open the incubator door
before I bust it open.

754
00:58:45,572 --> 00:58:47,866
Open it before I blow the door off,
you bastard!
