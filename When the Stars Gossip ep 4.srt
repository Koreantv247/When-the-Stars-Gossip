00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:47,964
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:51,426
<i>Eve!</i>

3
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:52,969
<i>Stay with me, Eve!</i>

4
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:56,264
<i>EV1, check your CO2 levels. EV1?</i>

5
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,599
-<i>Open your eyes, Eve.</i>
-<i>EV1?</i>

6
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:58,683
<i>Are you okay?</i>

7
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,685
-<i>Eve! Eve, stay with me.</i>
-<i>Stay awake!</i>

8
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,562
<i>Eve!</i>

9
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:12,113
{\an8}Let's see

10
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,201
{\an8}what she wrote in her will.

11
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:31,341
{\an8}<i>My adoptive father</i>
<i>was an American astronaut.</i>

12
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,593
{\an8}How does that look?
Should we get one more?

13
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,681
{\an8}Let's take another. Come on.

14
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,234
See if you can get the article.

15
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,737
My daughter's gonna see this.

16
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:53,988
She'll be proud.

17
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,831
<i>He died trying to save his colleague</i>
<i>during a spacewalk.</i>

18
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,672
<i>Right before the spacewalk,</i>

19
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,882
<i>he wrote me a letter,</i>

20
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:16,469
<i>and those turned out to be his last words.</i>

21
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,349
<i>"Dear Daughter,</i>

22
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,728
<i>once you come to this vast space</i>
<i>with no beginning or end, you'll see."</i>

23
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:32,193
<i>"Zinnias, lettuce, mayflies, even humans."</i>

24
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,446
<i>"Everything is weightless here."</i>

25
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:40,618
<i>"All living beings are equal."</i>

26
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:46,166
<i>"So do not carelessly step on</i>
<i>an earthworm in the backyard…"</i>

27
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,542
<i>…do not carelessly step…</i>

28
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,836
<i>"…or weed the lawn."</i>

29
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,212
<i>…or weed the lawn.</i>

30
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:56,092
<i>"They are miracles</i>
<i>made by the spirits of the universe."</i>

31
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:57,760
<i>Every…</i>

32
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,346
<i>"Every being is a miracle on its own."</i>

33
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,681
<i>…on its own.</i>

34
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:02,932
<i>That's what he said.</i>

35
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,144
"Every being…

36
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,814
is a miracle on its own."

37
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,112
<i>Eve!</i>

38
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,822
Grab whatever you can, Eve. Come on!

39
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,460
She's got a hold of it.

40
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,836
Eve, are you okay?

41
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,926
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,137
I think my glove is damaged.

43
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,063
<i>Here's your list of duties while I'm out.</i>

44
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,690
<i>This isn't a will, just a set of requests.</i>

45
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:56,861
<i>Okay, number one.</i>

46
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,156
<i>Run on the treadmill</i>
<i>for two hours straight</i>

47
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,992
<i>to keep your calcium levels up</i>
<i>until you return to Earth.</i>

48
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,286
<i>Zero gravity is a monster</i>
<i>that feeds on muscles.</i>

49
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:09,958
<i>Number two.</i>

50
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,418
<i>Put food in Public and Indecency's vial.</i>

51
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:13,878
<i>They need to eat to survive.</i>

52
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,298
<i>Keep an eye on the larvae</i>
<i>and check if they're molting.</i>

53
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:21,261
<i>Keep the temperature at 25 degrees</i>
<i>and humidity at 75% to help them along.</i>

54
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,223
<i>If they fail to molt and die,</i>
<i>there will be hell to pay.</i>

55
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:27,934
<i>Number three.</i>

56
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:30,853
<i>Change the IV and dressing</i>
<i>for the post-op male mouse.</i>

57
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,691
<i>Shake the NSAID and inject exactly 0.2 ml.</i>

58
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,820
<i>Gently. Don't hurt him, okay?</i>

59
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:40,822
<i>All right, number four.</i>

60
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:44,325
<i>There are three tubes of gochujang</i>
<i>at the back of my food storage locker</i>

61
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,994
<i>in the kitchen module.</i>

62
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,665
<i>You'll find a can of tuna there too.</i>
<i>If you're missing Korean spice,</i>

63
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,918
<i>try adding two tubes</i>
<i>of gochujang to the tuna.</i>

64
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,131
<i>Now, don't forget.</i>
<i>You have to leave one for me.</i>

65
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:02,719
<i>Number five.</i>

66
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:06,514
-<i>Once the spice gets your bowels moving…</i>
-Kang-su. Eve.

67
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,933
<i>…you have to poop by the end of the day.</i>

68
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:11,269
<i>I know you haven't pooped once</i>
<i>since you got here</i>

69
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,478
-<i>three days ago.</i>
-Gross.

70
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,315
<i>In zero gravity, the toxins</i>
<i>will spread throughout your body,</i>

71
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,858
<i>causing odor and even swelling.</i>

72
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:19,068
-<i>It's very dangerous.</i>
-Where is it?

73
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,071
<i>You haven't gone in three days,</i>
<i>so you'll need to push hard,</i>

74
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,657
<i>but zero gravity</i>
<i>weakens your blood vessels.</i>

75
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:27,910
<i>So make sure to alternate</i>
<i>between pushing and pausing.</i>

76
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:31,831
<i>You've got to take it easy,</i>
<i>or you could burst a blood vessel.</i>

77
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:36,586
Man, she's even telling me
how to take a dump now.

78
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,087
Where is it?

79
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,649
Found it.

80
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,784
EV1, body temperature 37.3 degrees,
your heart rate…

81
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,951
Fifty-seven?

82
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,996
Eve, check your glove. Is the hole bigger?

83
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,873
Her ECG levels are falling.

84
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,793
<i>EV1, check your CO2 levels.</i>

85
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:17,877
<i>EV1?</i>

86
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,462
<i>EV1?</i>

87
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,547
<i>Eve! Eve, stay with me.</i>

88
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:23,966
<i>Eve!</i>

89
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,102
<i>Number six.</i>

90
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,896
-<i>You're not an astronaut.</i>
-Shit.

91
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,190
<i>You're a visitor, so stay put</i>

92
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,400
<i>and do nothing, no matter what happens.</i>

93
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:46,405
IOU, this won't work.
Please find a different angle of approach.

94
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,200
Moving EV1 to a safe position.

95
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,756
Don't move. Stay as still as possible.

96
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,592
<i>You need to buy every second you can!</i>

97
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,344
Copy.

98
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,888
-EV2, repressurization complete.
-Repressurization done.

99
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,974
I'm switching places with Dr. Kang.

100
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:20,106
<i>Eve, how's your breathing?</i>

101
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,732
<i>Is the tear getting bigger?</i>

102
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,901
<i>Her heart rate is dropping.</i>

103
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,612
-Commander.
-<i>Check your CO2 levels.</i>

104
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,865
-Can you hear me? Commander.
-<i>EV1.</i>

105
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,160
It's still within the normal range.

106
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:33,995
I'm fine.

107
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,498
<i>You checked the reading?</i>
<i>Can you see the monitor?</i>

108
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,084
<i>Capcom, have we found</i>
<i>a different angle of approach?</i>

109
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,711
{\an8}We can't get a good angle.

110
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,630
{\an8}Her safety tether is attached
to a concave section on G.O-10.

111
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,132
There's just no way

112
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,759
we can bring her close enough to the hook

113
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,012
with the solar panel in the way.

114
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,058
<i>With her right hand</i>
<i>holding on to the panel,</i>

115
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,810
<i>it won't work with the robot arm.</i>

116
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:04,377
<i>Number seven.</i>

117
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:07,380
<i>Stay out of trouble like I said,</i>

118
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,300
<i>and I'll buy you a drink</i>
<i>when I'm back on Earth next year.</i>

119
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:18,766
<i>Lee, how much time is left?</i>

120
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:20,726
Fifteen minutes remaining
for decompression.

121
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,811
As soon as it's done,

122
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,105
you'll exit and unhook
Eve Kim's safety tether.

123
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:26,274
<i>Eve, don't move an inch until then.</i>

124
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,734
<i>If the tear gets any worse,</i>
<i>you're in real trouble.</i>

125
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,820
EV1, copy.

126
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,079
You must be cold.

127
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:46,919
It's minus 130 degrees out there.
Your feet must be freezing.

128
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,841
{\an8}How long have you been
standing there like that?

129
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,802
I mean, how much longer do you have to…

130
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,763
…like that?

131
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,062
Eve.

132
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:08,274
Eve. Wake up.

133
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,651
Look at me, okay? Eve!

134
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,863
Open your eyes. Eve!

135
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,133
I think I'm fine.

136
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,346
I'm okay.

137
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:41,849
You said you were fine
even when I stitched up your toes

138
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,601
without anesthesia.

139
00:10:43,684 --> 00:10:45,895
Will you please stop lying?

140
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,068
Pressure is dropping in your suit, Eve.

141
00:10:58,574 --> 00:10:59,408
Eve.

142
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,536
Come on, look at me. Eve!

143
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,538
Stay awake. Look at me, okay?

144
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:05,956
Eve!

145
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,085
I'm okay.

146
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,047
EV1's heart rate is dropping fast.

147
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:21,514
You said you'd buy me a drink
when you got back to Earth!

148
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:23,724
<i>EV1 seems to be…</i>

149
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,977
EV1 seems to be losing oxygen rapidly.

150
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,064
<i>EV1?</i>

151
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,816
<i>EV1!</i>

152
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,895
<i>Eve, respond! What's your oxygen level?</i>

153
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,649
I'm okay.

154
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,069
I think I can hold out.

155
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,406
Damn it.

156
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,616
You can't see the monitor?

157
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,368
You can't see it?

158
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,913
Shit.

159
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,749
Lee, how much longer for decompression?

160
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,792
<i>This is Airlock 1.</i>

161
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:34,253
<i>I'll go out, unhook her,</i>
<i>and bring her back right now!</i>

162
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:37,339
No, Seung-jun.

163
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,008
Finish decompression first.

164
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,596
You have to finish decompression first.

165
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,057
I think I can hold out until then.

166
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,061
<i>You've been acting like you're fine</i>
<i>this whole time?</i>

167
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,813
Airlock 1, preparing to exit.

168
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,024
Stop!
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

169
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,068
You'll be in danger too
without proper decompression.

170
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,570
Just wait till it's finished.

171
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,448
It's almost done, all right?
Stick to the protocol!

172
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,700
Her vitals are continuing to drop, Chief!

173
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:07,536
Don't stop me.
Do you want to lose her like this?

174
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:18,255
What the hell?

175
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:21,342
-What's going on?
-<i>Where's this coming from?</i>

176
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,974
Someone just opened G.O-10's hatch!

177
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,601
What?

178
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,118
Oh, my God!

179
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,719
That crazy bastard.

180
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,346
He's out of his damn mind.

181
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:14,311
You need to turn around and face me.

182
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,355
Turn around and face me right now.

183
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,274
I can't.

184
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,528
Are you even connected
to the oxygen supply?

185
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:23,988
I am.

186
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,908
I didn't want to blow up the station,

187
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,952
<i>so I closed its hatch too.</i>

188
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,038
{\an8}You'll get decompression sickness!
The gas bubbles will kill you!

189
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:34,623
{\an8}Mr. Gong.

190
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,127
Push your legs through the hatch,

191
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,295
close it, and get inside.

192
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,797
Do as I say.

193
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,383
No.

194
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,553
You looked like
you were about to die any second.

195
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,056
How could I just stay inside?

196
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,017
<i>You can't reach the hook,</i>

197
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,686
but I can reach it from here.
So how could I…

198
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,771
Anyway, forget about that.

199
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,609
Where's the hook to the safety tether?

200
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,277
Where do I go?

201
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,239
You skipped decompression. You could die.

202
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,826
Nitrogen narcosis is no joke.

203
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,120
So just tell me!

204
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,041
I'm not going back until I unhook you,

205
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:18,459
so tell me right now, okay?

206
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:23,088
I feel like I'm going to die.

207
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:27,384
Where is the damn hook?

208
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,678
For God's sake.

209
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,472
Look, Mr. Tourist.

210
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:34,934
Who goes out to space in a pressure suit
without decompressing?

211
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:38,395
In that suit, you won't last one…
No, not even two minutes.

212
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:39,563
Get back inside now!

213
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,482
<i>At this rate, they're both going to die!</i>

214
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,776
Screw the protocol.
I'm going out right now!

215
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:46,153
Just tell me where the hook is!

216
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:49,156
Let go of the handle and go down.

217
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,493
Mr. Gong is much closer to it than we are.

218
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,329
If they wait for Dr. Lee,
neither of them will make it.

219
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,833
Mr. Gong, listen carefully.

220
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,461
Go down and grab the hook.
You'll be able to reach it.

221
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,129
Gong Ryong. Just listen to me.

222
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,759
If you go back inside now,
you might still be okay.

223
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,761
Going down now.

224
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,930
Damn it, he just won't listen.

225
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,891
<i>He's the only one</i>
<i>who can save Eve right now.</i>

226
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,310
<i>He can reach the hook from there!</i>

227
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,354
<i>Theoretically,</i>
<i>he can last for a few minutes!</i>

228
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,855
For God's sake.

229
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,482
Come on.

230
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,074

This is an order.

232
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:34,910
Go back inside!

233
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:45,421
Where is the hook?

234
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,257
Go back inside.

235
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,846
Keep going. Go farther down.

236
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,765
<i>Hold on to that right there.</i>

237
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,766
Copy.

238
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,271
Going down.

239
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,236
I can't reach it.

240
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,036
Come on!

241

We can't see any further.

246
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,179
This is insane.

247
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,930
What do I do then?

248
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,850
What do I do now?

249
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:42,770

251
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,695
I can't do it.

it's likely that both its motility

322
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:53,283
and DNA integrity are compromised.

323
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,744
But in a zero-gravity environment,

324
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,914
we're hoping that
at least three of them will fertilize.

325
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,040
All seven of them will.

326
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,583
Sure, of course.

327
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,793
-I have a good feeling.
-Yes, all seven of them.

328
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:20,602
Dr. Jeon.

329
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,688
The director thinks I don't know anything,

330
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,232
and I need to keep it that way.

331
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,609
Have you talked to Ryong?

332
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:31,196
I haven't been able to reach him
for hours. I'm worried sick.

333
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,323
He's not taking my calls either.

334
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,325
Do you think he got caught?

335
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,204
He might be dead.

336
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,705
What?

337
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:45,085
He said he was going to keep running
on the treadmill until the motor exploded.

338
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:47,462
Maybe he tore a muscle
while he was running,

339
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:50,924
or his heart couldn't handle the strain
in zero gravity and went into arrest,

340
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,175
or his arteries ruptured.

341
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:54,469
Something must've gone wrong for sure.

342
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:58,265
How could he risk his life
to steal back some eggs? That's insane.

343
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,392
If something really happened to him,

344
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,603
I'm not letting it slide,
whether it's the director or the chairman.

345
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,439
How's Min-jeong doing?

346
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,857
-Is she all right?
-Yes, sir.

347
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,401
Right this way, sir.

348
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,408
The chairman is here.

349
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,618
How are you feeling?

350
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:23,373
Well, everything looks good, sir.

351
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,917
You can go now.

352
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,002
Yes, sir.

353
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,135
You should start preparing
for your pregnancy now.

354
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:37,304
Kang-su will make it happen soon,

355
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:40,265
so stop working
and just focus on your health.

356
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:44,728
Once my grandchild is born,
I'll put them on a pedestal.

357
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,771
I won't let their feet touch the ground,

358
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,940
and I'll make sure every door

359
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,901
is opened for them so they'll never
even have to touch a doorknob.

360
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,487
They'll be raised like royalty.

361
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:57,115
I'll get them the best teachers

362
00:26:57,198 --> 00:27:00,910
so they can learn business management
and take over MZ Group after Go-eun.

363
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,495
No.

364
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:06,124
Once the baby is born,
I'm leaving with them.

365
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,709
What?

366
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,836
The child is mine.

367
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,212
How I raise them is up to me.

368
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:13,506
I've decided

369
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,718
I won't let them turn out like you.

370
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,178
Who do you think you are?

371
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,181
You have no idea how much
Dong-hun struggled growing up, do you?

372
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,059
He didn't want to go into management,

373
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,478
but you forced him
into that construction job,

374
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,772
and it got him killed.

375
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,691
I know you'll do the same to my child,

376
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,861
and I won't tolerate

377
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:38,323
your controlling ways
and restrictions anymore.

378
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:39,324
Are you…

379
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,954
Are you saying
it's my fault Dong-hun died?

380
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,792
Did you ever ask him…

381
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,670
what he really wanted?

382
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:56,925
He was miserable his whole life,

383
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,387
and he died trying to save someone else.

384
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,805
That's who he was.

385
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,932
He was different from you.

386
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:06,309
That's why

387
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:10,772
he also wanted to leave you
if we had a child.

388
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:11,689
Shut it!

389
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:16,236
I'm the one who spent 70 billion
to send Gong Ryong up to space!

390
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:17,737
This is about my child,

391
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,532
but you changed my doctor
without my consent,

392
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:23,785
and you're already controlling their life

393
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,371
when they're just a handful of cells,
not even an embryo.

394
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:28,289
Imagine what you'll do once they're born.

395
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,042
As their mother, I can't let that happen.

396
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,755
Did you ask the child
if they want to inherit MZ Group?

397
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,801
Who in this world
wouldn't want money and power?

398
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,887
The child has my genes,

399
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,140
so I know.

400
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,268
They're going to be someone like me,

401
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,812
living with pride
and the whole world at their feet!

402
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,190
Don't kid yourself.
They won't be like you.

403
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,236
Things won't go according to your plans.

404
00:28:58,319 --> 00:28:59,904
You can thank me later.

405
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,450
Just quit your job here
and focus on your health.

406
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,493
What's so great about being a damn doctor?

407
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,797
I want Na Min-jeong fired.

408
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,215
Effective immediately!

409
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,342
-Clear her office this minute.
-Yes, sir.

410
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:25,346
If I see her working in this hospital,

411
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,265
-you'll be fired too.
-Sir?

412
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:29,559
<i>CEO Choi Go-eun of MZ Electronics</i>

413
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,728
<i>has announced her engagement</i>
<i>to Dr. Gong Ryong,</i>

414
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,147
<i>an ob-gyn formerly</i>
<i>with the MZ Medical Center.</i>

415
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:38,318
{\an8}<i>Dr. Gong is currently aboard</i>

417
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,322
{\an8}<i>Here's a clip from the press conference.</i>

418
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,533
Has the chairman
officially given his blessing?

419
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:48,328
Of course.

420
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:51,039
<i>When will the engagement ceremony be?</i>

421
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,583

423

-Ladies.
-<i>We'll cherish our time together.</i>

424
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:58,797
I think…

425
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,757
<i>We'll cultivate a happy marriage…</i>

426
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,384
-We should go dress shopping.
-<i>…built on love and trust.</i>

427
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,358
<i>…didn't go to the space station for fun.</i>

428
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,318
<i>As a doctor,</i>

429
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:23,655
<i>he's taken an important first step</i>
<i>in the life sciences industry</i>

430
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,698
<i>that MZ Group will lead in the future.</i>

431
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,909
Could you say a few words to Mr. Gong?

432
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,251
I miss you.

433
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,254
Stay healthy,

434
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,215
and please make it home safe and sound.

435
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:49,347
{\an8}GONG RYONG'S 4TH DAY

436
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,038
I'm worried.

437
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,499
He'll get better, won't he?

438
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,043
He has to.

439
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,699
Thanks to Na-mi,

440
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,702
we haven't had to go
to a hair salon in the last 30 years.

441
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:55,204
It's way too expensive to get a perm.

442
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,999
She could do our hair
when we meet the girl's family too.

443
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:03,463
Do you think a day like this would've come
if it weren't for Na-mi?

444
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,966
Imagine if she hadn't convinced us
to raise Ryong back then.

445
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,429
Ryong should forever be grateful to Na-mi,
even more than to us.

446
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,691
NA-MI'S HAIR SALON

447
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,645
<i>Eve.</i>

448
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:03,272
Only you can see it now.

449
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:09,862
Only you can see it now!

450
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,700
Do you want more noodles?

451
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:58,494
No, I don't have time.
I've got to run and prep for surgery.

452
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,955
Slow down. You'll get indigestion.

453
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:06,419
You got a perm?

454
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:08,629
Pretty.

455
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,844
Yi-man just called me pretty.

456
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,847
Who says that to their friend's mom?

457
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,973
I can hear you.

458
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,224
RYONGSTER

459
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,481
You asshole!

460
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,524
Geez.

461
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:32,361
Nothing happened. What's with the yelling?

462
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,489
I'm done being friends with you, you jerk.

463
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,325
<i>You're just going to give me</i>
<i>a heart attack at this rate,</i>

464
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,827
so I'm done, okay? Just forget everything.

465
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,037
<i>Forget what?</i>

466
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,706
Are you saying you don't want to
check on my moms anymore?

467
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,833
Sure, you can forget about that too.

468
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,919
-Can we have more kimchi, please?
-Sure.

469
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,796
Hey, your moms?

470
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:53,549
They're doing way better than you.
Stronger and healthier too.

471
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:56,219
Hell, they'll probably even outlive you.

472
00:34:56,302 --> 00:35:00,556
They just got a perm too,
and they're loving it.

473
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,059
You worry about your own life.

474
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:06,938
They may look fine on the outside,
but they're a mess on the inside.

475
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,981
They take fistfuls of meds every day.

476
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,067
<i>So? Did you run that marathon?</i>

477
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,652
You bet.

478
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,322
No one knows what I did.

479
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,909
But you couldn't have been
running until now.

480
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:22,620
<i>What took you so long to call me?</i>

481
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:23,955
So, are you feeling okay?

482
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,624
I'm fine. Let me talk to my moms.

483
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,091
Listen, things have been crazy over here.

484
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,009
Go-eun announced her engagement to you.

485
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:39,595
What did you say?

486
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,431
<i>She said there'd be a ceremony</i>
<i>as soon as you got back.</i>

487
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,351
<i>Look, just go for it.</i>

488
00:35:45,434 --> 00:35:46,811
<i>Get engaged and marry Go-eun.</i>

489
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:49,564
<i>You can just refuse</i>
<i>to take any money from her father.</i>

490
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,080
What?

491
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,171
-Hi.
-You're up.

492
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,966
Good news,
the nitrogen cleared out with no issues.

493
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,510
You really pulled through.

494
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:20,928
You got incredibly lucky.

495
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,889
Thank you.

496
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,601
You can come out
once we finish adjusting the pressure.

497
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,518
Hang tight for a bit.

498
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:29,896
Wait.

499
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:35,359
How's the commander?

500
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:40,990
Chief.

501
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,827
Eve's vitals are back to normal too.

502
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:48,164
Mr. Gong's hyperbaric treatment
is finished, and there's no tissue damage.

503
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,709
I think we can relax now.

504
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,338
Good work, everyone.

505
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,798
I should go lie down in my office.

506
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,594
Hey, you. Outsider.

507
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,137
You really should go now.

508
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,972
They might think you're the boss here.

509
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,100
After I talk to Eve.

510
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,064
You…

511
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:15,942
Are you…

512
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,861
What, are you jealous?
You care more about Eve than I do.

513
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,158
Chief.

514
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,370
I just talked to the IOU legal team.

515
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,914
They're having an emergency meeting
about yesterday,

516
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,041
and they want you to attend.

517
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,252
What's your question?

518
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,047
Never mind.

519
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:41,133
-What time?
-Now.

520
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,898
Thanks. You should go get some rest.

521
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,025
-Would you like some porridge?
-No, thanks.

522
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,236
Where are you going? I'll take you.

523
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:02,738
What's with you?

524
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:05,366
I'm sorry I left you behind.

525
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:08,452
Don't worry about it.

526
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,539
I'm going to the bathroom.

527
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:17,837
Right, the bathroom.

528
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,364
Are you feeling all right?

529
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:48,951
Ladies first.

530
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,787
Thought you were really going to die--

531
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:12,141
I know I shouldn't have done that.

532
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,604
I'm just a tourist,
and I should've known my place.

533
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:20,816
The accident that could've ended with
just me dying almost killed two people.

534
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:25,446
But because there were two of us,

535
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,989
we both survived.

536
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:30,951
We astronauts know we could die
at any time, and we're prepared for that.

537
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:34,038
But you're a tourist, a human.
We can't let you die out here.

538
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,664
Aren't astronauts humans too?

539
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,667
Aren't all lives equal?

540
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:41,170
You believe
even the life of a fruit fly or a mouse

541
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:43,381
has value and meaning, right?
Was that a lie?

542
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,884
If you had died,
it would've been like killing me twice.

543
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,221
I'll never forgive you for that.

544
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,309
I'm sorry, Commander.

545
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,270
I shouldn't have done it,
and I feel terrible.

546
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,649
It won't happen again. Please forgive me.

547
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,077
For the next four days
until you go back to Earth,

548
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,037
act as if you're dead,
and don't do anything.

549
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,497
Don't touch anything,

550
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,874
and stop all your ongoing projects.

551
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:24,130
Just enjoy your time here quietly
until you go back.

552
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,548
And while you do…

553
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:31,846
Actually, even afterward,
stay out of my sight.

554
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,849
I don't even want to see you.

555
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:35,975
Is that clear?

556
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:37,893
Eve.

557
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:49,029
Act as if I'm dead and don't do anything?
I can't do that. I'm alive.

558
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,657
This place is like a mid-sized apartment.

559
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,952
How do you expect me to stay
out of your sight in this cramped space?

560
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:57,496
It's not like we can go outside.
We share a bathroom,

561
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,416
and you sleep right across from me.
How can I stay out--

562
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,834
I'll sleep somewhere else.

563
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,169
What?

564
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,173
The mission commander wandering around

565
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:10,092
looking for a place to sleep
because of some tourist?

566
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:12,887
That's ridiculous.

567
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,141
I'm really sorry about what I did.

568
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:18,559
I just didn't know any better.

569
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,021
I didn't realize
how dangerous it was, all right?

570
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,731
What do I know? I'm just a tourist.

571
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,900
You did know better.

572
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:29,987
You knew how dangerous it was,
but you jumped out anyway.

573
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,239
That's why I can't forgive you.

574
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,200
Commander, please.

575
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:35,951
I was being reckless.

576
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:41,207
Sometimes I can be impulsive like that.

577
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:42,541
Please forgive me.

578
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,338
Commander.

579
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:58,742
Section 3, Clause 4
of the IOU-space tourist agreement.

580
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:02,663
"If the tourist causes any issues
at the space station

581
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,374
by taking unauthorized dangerous actions,

582
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:08,294
the IOU will enforce
disciplinary measures."

583
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,671
You do remember signing that, don't you?

584
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,673
I know, okay? I know that.

585
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,467
You can't blame the commander.

586
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,677
I didn't say anything.

587
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,179
I guess you can't do anything now.

588
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:20,514
Mission control

589
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:24,810
will also tell you to stop
all your projects, keep your head down,

590
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:28,105
and do nothing but exist
for the remainder of your stay.

591
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,190
Good for you, huh?

592
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,942
You've got nothing to do anyway.

593
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:40,159
Let me clue you in on something.

594
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,747
As of yesterday,
the eggs are back in my possession.

595
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,584
I won't give up.

596
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,713
Let me clue you in on something.

597
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:57,593
I managed to fertilize the eggs
from MZ Group yesterday.

598
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:03,015
Six out of seven fertilized.

599
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,785
<i>Could you say a few words to Mr. Gong?</i>

600
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,538
<i>I miss you.</i>

601
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,290
<i>Stay healthy,</i>

602
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:13,168
<i>and please make it home safe and sound.</i>

603
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,338
MZ ELECTRONICS CEO CHOI GO-EUN
ENGAGEMENT ANNOUNCEMENT

604
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:30,227
Hey, can you make sure
to take a bunch of pictures?

605
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,104
The tear right here on Eve's glove?

606
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:36,859
Yeah, I'm going to send it over to MCC.

607
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,531
Oh, hi, there.

608
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:44,700
Why'd you come all the way here
to use this bathroom?

609
00:45:45,701 --> 00:45:49,288
Are they seriously being jerks and
not letting you use the one over there?

610
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:52,166
That is so petty.

611
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,126
You okay?

612
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:57,838
You look down.

613
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:03,844
Can I sleep in a corner somewhere here?

614
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,680
Although I doubt I'll be able to sleep.

615
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,270
We've got the best remedy for that.

616
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,525
<i>Stairway to Heaven</i>.

617
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:25,240
And he's buying our "stairway to heaven."

618
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:26,867
What?

619
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,412
Wait, that's…

620
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:38,712
No, I had it hidden under the veggies.

621
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:41,465
Damn it, Mina.
Sew the ticket into your underwear.

622
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:43,425
You're making me so anxious.

623
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:45,344
My underwear? Where exactly?

624
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:47,721
<i>Your bra.</i>

625
00:46:47,804 --> 00:46:49,181
Sew it into your bra

626
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,891
before anyone else sees it.

627
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:53,143
You just sleep anywhere
without your own CQ.

628
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:58,774
But Dona, the tourist
was staring right at the ticket.

629
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:02,694
Get a hold of yourself.

630
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:06,323
Even if Gong Ryong saw it, how would
he know it was a winning ticket?

631
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,534
<i>We've got a month.</i>

632
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,994
As long as we claim it in time,
the money is ours.

633
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:14,665
Why do you keep talking like
this is ours when it's not?

634
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,919
The person who lost it
hasn't bothered with it all year.

635
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:20,879
That ticket doesn't belong to anyone.

636
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:24,174
This lottery ticket belongs to
whoever wrote "Stand by me."

637
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:27,261
What if they find out about this later?

638
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:31,181
I told you,
this is our destiny written by the cosmos!

639
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,324
I don't understand.
Why would she punish you

640
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:51,868
when she should've just rewarded you?

641
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:54,037
I mean, you saved her life,
for God's sake.

642
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:57,749
If I were her,
I would be bound to you forever!

643
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,711
"Rule book this, rule book that."

644
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:02,671
Since when is the manual more important

645
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:04,840
than saving someone's life?

646
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:06,049
Hey.

647
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,260
Hey!

648
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,971
Do you know how cool he was out there?

649
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,473
-He was awesome.
-What's that?

650
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:14,391
You…

651
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:17,603
were awesome.

652
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:21,023
Yeah, awesome.

653
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:27,738
Look. Isn't it strictly forbidden
to bring alcohol up here?

654
00:48:28,488 --> 00:48:29,323
What was that?

655
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:31,742
If Eve finds out, we're toast.

656
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,035
Oh, this

657
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,203
will never be allowed in here.

658
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,997
But do you know why

659
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,125
I risked my career, and thus my life,
smuggling it in?

660
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:44,963
To become more humane. To feel.

661
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:49,509
Don't be so rigid about it.
It's so we can moisten our throats.

662
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,137
It's so dreary and dry here.

663
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:56,058
No water, no air, no alcohol.

664
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:58,143
So, no affection.

665
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,228
Right.

666
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:04,858
This is our gift to you.

667
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:08,945
To our hero, Fantasia!

668
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:13,241
From now on, the pack has got your back.

669
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,972
You are probably the only,

670
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,808
first and only anthropoids

671
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:39,935
to ever take a shot in here.

672
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:41,478
But when we get back down…

673
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,741
Just make sure to hide it later.

674
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:59,871
Well, you can do this any day on Earth.

675
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:04,710
That's why I call it heaven. Good night.

676
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:06,294
-Good night.
-Night.

677
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:09,673
Okay, then.

678
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:12,384
I'm going to go check on the mice.

679
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:14,970
You can sleep in the CQ.

680
00:50:16,096 --> 00:50:19,057
There's a window in the quarters here.

681
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,436
Unlike the ones on the other side.

682
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:26,857
Just lie down and watch Earth.

683
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:31,027
You'll start to feel totally at ease
and drift off to sleep.

684
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:32,946
See you.

685
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:34,573
Good night.

686
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:35,824
Night.

687
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:41,765
Santi.

688
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:44,643
Santi!

689
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:58,281
I totally regret coming up here, but…

690
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,742
Santi.

691
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:04,412
I'm going to make sure
that people like you,

692
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,832
who struggle to have kids,
can have them too.

693
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:10,252
I'm not going back empty-handed.

694
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:13,463
Good night.

695
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,441
I saw the lottery ticket.

696
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,362
It belongs to Kang Kang-su.

697
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:40,740
"Stand by me." I saw it
written on one of his photos too.

698
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:42,367
Kang Kang-su?

699
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:50,834
Yeah, I was going to give it back!

700
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,627
What, you think…

701
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:57,716
You think I'm the kind of person
who'd steal 500 billion from someone?

702
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:03,471
I've just been keeping it
because I didn't know whose it was.

703
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:07,350
Once I find out… I mean, I just did.
Yeah, and now that I know,

704
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:10,520
I'm going to give it back to Kang-su!

705
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:14,024
What?

706
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:16,735
Wait, you're going to give it back to him?

707
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:17,861
Yeah!

708
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:21,948
Well…

709
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:26,494
Do you really have to give it back to him?

710
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:28,580
What?

711
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:29,706
Are you insane?

712
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,625
Why would you give it back?

713
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:33,585
He's got plenty of money.

714
00:53:33,668 --> 00:53:36,755
He's a trillionaire, okay?
Not just a billionaire.

715
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:38,632
Man, I really don't get it.

716
00:53:38,715 --> 00:53:42,010
He doesn't even care he won.
He hasn't even bothered to look for it.

717
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:43,595
Giving him 500 billion

718
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:46,181
is like pouring
a bottle of water into a river.

719
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:52,187
You should keep it.

720
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:55,982
It's definitely yours, okay?

721
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:56,900
I'll just…

722
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,152
pretend I didn't see.

723
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:01,071
But in return,

724
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:04,032
later on, help me just one time,
no questions asked.

725
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:06,785
Then I'll act like I didn't see it, okay?

726
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:10,205
I didn't see anything!

727
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,624
I didn't see anything.

728
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:14,834
I know nothing.

729
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,440
Dr. Lee!

730
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,192
Hey, why didn't you go to sleep?

731
00:54:39,275 --> 00:54:40,276
Dr. Lee.

732
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,654
You should go to sleep.

733
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:48,785
I bet you think I don't realize
how amazing the work you're doing here is.

734
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:51,705
But I do know, okay?

735
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:54,582
Right.

736
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:57,919
Please,

737
00:54:59,087 --> 00:55:00,922
I'm asking you.

738
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:07,137
Please do your best to study Alzheimer's
using these mice

739
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,889
and make sure
you develop a vaccine for it.

740
00:55:11,391 --> 00:55:14,686
So that no mother in the world
would ever forget where she lives

741
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,480
or stop recognizing her kids.

742
00:55:18,106 --> 00:55:21,109
You know how Alzheimer's patients
often get Parkinson's and lose muscle?

743
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,819
Do something about that too.

744
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,738
Find a way to stop that from happening.

745
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:29,159
Help everyone who lives to be 100

746
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:33,788
avoid Alzheimer's and be able to keep
their nice, juicy muscles.

747
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:34,706
Just go to sleep.

748
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:47,260
You've got to make it happen, Dr. Lee!

749
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,096
I'm counting on you!

750
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,021
Damn it.

751
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:43,566
This clumsy body.

752
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,367
I'm not going back empty-handed.

753
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,047
What? What are you doing?

754
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,009
Back off!

755
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,318
Have you been drinking?

756
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:09,819
Yeah.

757
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:17,869
Look, what did I do that was so wrong?

758
00:58:17,952 --> 00:58:20,205
I honestly don't think
I did anything wrong.

759
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:22,582
Even if I could go back,
I'd do the same thing.

760
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:25,585
Open up the hatch,
jump out like an idiot, and save you.

761
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:27,921
Would I have been rewarded

762
00:58:28,004 --> 00:58:30,465
if I had let you die
while decompressing and suiting up?

763
00:58:30,548 --> 00:58:32,634
I was groveling earlier,
but I take it back.

764
00:58:32,717 --> 00:58:34,928
What I did was good.
I did the right thing.

765
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,055
Give me a pat
and tell me I did the right thing.

766
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:43,394
Come on, just say thank you.

767
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,776
I really have no idea

768
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,029
how I'm supposed
to stay out of your sight.

769
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:04,541
Where did you get the alcohol?

770
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:12,215
Is it okay if I like you?

771
00:59:17,053 --> 00:59:18,388
No?

772
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:30,400
-You're drunk.
-I'm not drunk at all.

773
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:44,581
Is that okay?

774
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:10,898
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

775
01:00:11,649 --> 01:00:14,652
{\an8}<i>You absolutely cannot</i>
<i>have feelings for me.</i>

776
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:15,945
{\an8}This is an order.

777
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,905
{\an8}<i>Am I so unattractive?</i>

778
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:20,700
{\an8}<i>All seven of them</i>
<i>have developed into morulas.</i>

779
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:23,202
{\an8}Don't do it.
Dr. Kang Kang-su can take over.

780
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:29,250
{\an8}He's letting me have 500 billion.
Just imagine what he'll ask for in return!

781
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,336
{\an8}<i>I really hate that you're leaving.</i>

782
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:34,922
{\an8}Eve doesn't know much about men.

783
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:37,759
{\an8}<i>Men who betray women are absolute trash.</i>

784
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:42,597
{\an8}Ryong doesn't like you
as much as you like him.

785
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,890
{\an8}<i>I…</i>

786
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:46,309
