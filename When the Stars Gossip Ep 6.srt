1
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:47,964
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

2
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:10,487
These are the images
of Ms. Na's eggs fertilized

3
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,114
with Mr. Choi's sperm,
now divided into 16 cells.

4
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,617
They're your seven grandchildren, sir.

5
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:20,121
We'll select the three healthiest ones
with the highest chance of success

6
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,166
and implant them in her uterus.

7
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:25,835
Min-jeong, are you feeling better now?

8
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:29,047
Yes, Father.
I'm taking good care of myself.

9
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,590
I'm perfectly healthy.

10
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:33,927
Now I can die without any regrets.

11
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,557
Aren't you going to say congratulations?

12
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,159
This belongs to a human.

13
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:00,495
Is it a morula?

14
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,080
Wow, a morula?

15
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,583
Yes, it's a human morula.

16
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:10,505
Dr. Lee, turn off the lab's power.
We need to disengage the locks.

17
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,883
-Okay.
-Wait.

18
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,177
At least give me a chance
to explain first.

19
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,356
Have you lost your mind?

20
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:31,025
Open it.

21
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,100
Is this it?

22
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,578
Excuse me.

23
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:28,833
Unbelievable.

24
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,669
Is this…

25
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:33,796
Is this an actual human morula?

26
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:48,645
Congratulations, Min-jeong.

27
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:54,692
Thank you.

28
00:03:55,193 --> 00:03:56,945
{\an8}Once the morulas arrive,

29
00:03:57,737 --> 00:04:01,658
{\an8}I'll get you the best team of doctors,
way better than Gong Ryong.

30
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:03,493
{\an8}Just trust me.

31
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:05,119
{\an8}All right.

32
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:06,537
{\an8}Chairman.

33
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,374
{\an8}Ryong hasn't done anything up there.

34
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,500
{\an8}End things with him.

35
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,502
{\an8}I can't accept just anyone into my family.

36
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,003
{\an8}Dad!

37
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,964
{\an8}Kang-su is the one who did all the work.

38
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,465
{\an8}Marry him instead.

39
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,931
A human egg has never been
brought up to the space station.

40
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:28,810
Just how did you bring these up here?

41
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,937
Whose are they?

42
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,816
They were donated by an egg bank

43
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,777
for experimental purposes.

44
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,821
They were meant to be used

45
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:44,284
for the infertility research where
I compared sterile fruit flies to humans.

46
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:48,663
I hid them under the holders
for the fruit fly vials and snuck them in.

47
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,500
What about the sperm?

48
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,627
The sperm.

49
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,841
Did you use your own?

50
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,143
I stole one of Santi's samples.

51
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,484
The sperm are yours.

52
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,571
What, mine?

53
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,239
You used my sperm?

54
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,284
I experimented with the frozen sperm

55
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,620
that you always keep in the freezer.

56
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,875
So these embryos… These…

57
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:36,085
These morulas.

58
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,880
They're all my babies?

59
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,051
I know the situation is bad,

60
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,346
and I'm sorry. I know I broke the rules,

61
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,015
but just think about it.

62
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,852
Santi's sperm can't fertilize eggs
on Earth

63
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,980
due to their abnormal morphology
and genetic defects,

64
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,274
but I made it happen here.
Isn't that incredible?

65
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,985
Shut up! You don't even deserve
to be called a scientist.

66
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,821
What's wrong with
a scientist stretching his imagination?

67
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:06,240
Someone had to try it sooner or later.

68
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,160
You've all been dying to know
if people who can't get pregnant

69
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,287
can have children in space!

70
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,706
I know you wanted to try it too.

71
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,918
Let's be honest, Commander.

72
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,295
You spend every day
with those damn mice asking,

73
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,089
"Did they bump uglies today?"

74
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,175
"Will they do it today? Tomorrow?"

75
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,594
"Has the vaginal plug formed?"

76
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,179
You never take your eyes off them

77
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,264
so you can make it possible for humans.

78
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:36,562
Haven't you been itching to skip
the mice and try this yourself?

79
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,574
I'm discarding these.

80
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,370
You're discarding them?

81
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:55,081
Santi, I have to discard these.

82
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,708
Sorry.

83
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,971
I'll discard them
and report this to MCC right away.

84
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,306
Dr. Kang, stay here
and wait for instructions.

85
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:14,892
Commander.

86
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:16,894
Commander.

87
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:17,812
Damn it.

88
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:30,658
What do we do now?

89
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,413
I know you're laughing
and celebrating on the inside, you jerk.

90
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,039
Hey.

91
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,543
The morulas are 400 km away
from their mom's uterus.

92
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,588
At least one of them has to make it there.

93
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,506
It doesn't matter who created it.

94
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,261
Damn.

95
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:51,888
What are you…

96
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,433
What are you going to do?

97
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,330
Commander.

98
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,457
Commander!

99
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,418
Those are human lives.

100
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,712
These are just cells.

101
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,298
The nuclei met and divided. That's it.

102
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:30,134
Life begins from the moment
a sperm meets an egg.

103
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,844
You're talking about the future.

104
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:35,848
Right now, these are
nothing more than balls of 16 cells.

105
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:37,934
A morula is essentially a person.

106
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,477
It's already a living thing.

107
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,647
Save your sentimental ob-gyn talk
for when you're back on Earth.

108
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,107
You're at a space station.

109
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,444
You don't know what this means here,
so stay out of it.

110
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,197
You thought it was amazing
when a fruit fly gave birth.

111
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,074
How can you destroy human lives

112
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,159
just because it's against the rules?

113
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:59,038
Fine, let's say you're right,
and these are human lives.

114
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:01,290
Yes, please.

115
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:05,670
These cells carry a type of energy
that doesn't exist on Earth.

116
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,673
No one can predict how they will develop

117
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,300
when this unidentified energy
goes to Earth.

118
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,637
Who's to say whether they'll become
a cancer mass or a mass of life?

119
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,558
Space is full of radiation
and unknown cosmic rays.

120
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:21,060
Even if you froze these cells,

121
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:24,814
they'd still be completely exposed
to unpredictable risks.

122
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:28,943
It's not like they'd be protected
by a buffer like a mother's womb.

123
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,028
They must be destroyed.

124
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,364
Facing those risks

125
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,575
is the fate this life-form was born with.

126
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:39,203
That's not something
we can decide on our own.

127
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:42,123
They have to face their own fate.

128
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,874
Let's let them decide

129
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,128
their own destiny, okay?

130
00:09:49,338 --> 00:09:50,590
Commander.

131
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,052
What…

132
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,686
Wait a second.

133
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,187
You can't be serious.

134
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,190
You want to crush these human lives
like medical waste

135
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,525
and shoot them into space?

136
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,278
You want to let Dr. Kang play God
and create human life here?

137
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,071
He stole a teammate's sperm

138
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:17,325
and shoved it
into some random woman's eggs.

139
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,744
These could turn into cancer or mutants.

140
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,120
He put us in grave danger.

141
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:25,249
He thought
he could create humans like God,

142
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,834
and he was conquering his fear.

143
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,670
He was just being arrogant,
justifying his actions like that.

144
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:34,008
Dr. Kang completely disregarded
space ethics.

145
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,134
Let go of me.

146
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,388
Science is for humanity.
Do your ethics really mean more?

147
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,433
Your experiments with mice
to get them to mate, get pregnant,

148
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:45,269
and give birth
are all for human benefit, aren't they?

149
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,772
Let go.

150
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:53,235
You're trying to make it possible
for humans to have sex, get pregnant,

151
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:54,987
and give birth in space too.

152
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,200
It's about finding a way for humanity

153
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:02,244
to continue across generations
beyond Earth.

154
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,165
Think of these living beings

155
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,335
as the starting point for that.

156
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,795
The beginning of it.

157
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,756
Natural conception or not,

158
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,926
they're still human beings
who could survive all the radiation

159
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:19,470
and unknown rays
and be born despite the obstacles.

160
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,516
Please see it that way.

161
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,859
{\an8}These morulas will soon
develop into blastocysts,

162
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,320
{\an8}and unverified blastocysts

163
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,614
{\an8}cannot enter Earth
under any circumstances.

164
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:43,119
No!

165
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:40,676
We'll load it onto the spacecraft below
with the other waste

166
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,636
and burn it up in the atmosphere.

167
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,472
Murderer.

168
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,309
Excuse me?

169
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,480
You murderer.

170
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:09,788
<i>Murderer!</i>

171
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:16,712
Say that again.

172
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,172
You're a murderer.

173
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,340
And you're two-faced.

174
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,635
Murderer!

175
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,682
I regret ever falling for you
or feeling my heart race because of you.

176
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,977
I regret risking my life
to save someone like you.

177
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,104
I should've just let you die.

178
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,357
I'll never try to save you again.

179
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,318
I didn't know
you were so cruel and heartless.

180
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:43,113
I asked if it was okay if I liked you.

181
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,281
I take it all back!

182
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,701
Good.

183
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:50,621
I'm so over you.

184
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,707
I can't stand you.

185
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,210
That's what I wanted.

186
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,504
I thought space was like a womb,

187
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,965
but it's a tomb, isn't it?

188
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:03,634
Not a place of creation…

189
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:09,223
but a place of death?

190
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,618
Seoul?

191
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:38,878
<i>Astronaut Kang Kang-su created embryos</i>
<i>using unauthorized human eggs and sperm.</i>

192
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,590
<i>The embryos, which developed into morulas,</i>

193
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:46,218
were immediately discarded
as per protocol.

194
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,471
This is all a result of my negligence.

195
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,849
I will take responsibility and step down.

196
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,364
<i>Kang Kang-su.</i>

197
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:11,327
<i>You have violated bioethics</i>
<i>and put humanity in danger</i>

198
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,954
<i>with unauthorized experiments.</i>

199
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,706
<i>You caused chaos at the space station</i>

200
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,959

201
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,337
Effective immediately,

202
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,089
you're dismissed from Expedition 3.

203
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:27,927
<i>You're no longer a fellow astronaut.</i>

204
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:33,015
<i>The final disciplinary action will be</i>
<i>determined upon your return in three days.</i>

205
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:37,603
Now, Commander Eve, you said
you'd resign to take responsibility,

206
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:40,773
but I'm ordering you
to continue your duties as commander.

207
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:42,816
<i>That will be all.</i>

208

KOREA SPACE AGENCY

209
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,201
<i>Don't do it.</i>

210
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,955
<i>Dr. Kang Kang-su can take over.</i>

211
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,832
<i>If you get caught,</i>

212
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,960
it could jeopardize Dr. Kang's work.

213
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,928
Geez, what the…

214
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,643
Why are you taking that apart?

215
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:04,356
I thought he was using this
to work on fruit flies, but he wasn't.

216
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,985
Who knows if some other lunatic
will try to do the same thing?

217
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,781
But what about me?
I was given assignments.

218
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,450
Come on, the eggs are already gone.

219
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,745
All I need to do is observe
the motility of the frozen sperm.

220
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,705
I need this, Commander.

221
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,252
I told you to stop all ongoing projects.

222
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,295
Commander.

223
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,714
Commander!

224
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,426
Wait, Commander.

225
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:36,346
Use the microscope here in the main module
if you need to observe sperm motility.

226
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,098
It's under CCTV surveillance.

227
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:40,392
Hey!

228
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,644
I paid 70 billion won to be here.

229
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,188
I'm a VIP, all right?

230
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:46,982
Why do I have to tiptoe around
and ask for your permission?

231
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,614
That's equipment
for the biological module.

232
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:00,913
Why are you locking it?

233
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,709
That means I can't use it.

234
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,380
DONG-A

235
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:26,772
From now on, you'll need my permission
to use this microscope for ICSI.

236
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,525
Everything from setup to usage

237
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:32,277
will be recorded 24-7 on CCTV.

238
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,572
Tourist or not, there are no exceptions.

239
00:18:37,908 --> 00:18:40,077
Damn it.

240
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,144
CHAIRMAN CHOI JAE-RYONG

241
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,911
Hey, pour her a glass.

242
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,037
Yes, sir.

243
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,456
Father, I'd rather not drink.

244
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,750
We've got to celebrate.

245
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,627
You won't be able to drink for a while.

246
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,964
Right, I'll just have a sip then.

247
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,595
You're better than my own daughter.

248
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,515
Once you have the baby,
you can run the hospital.

249
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:46,143
I'll make you the director.

250
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,988
You don't even want to eat with me now?

251
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,536
Listen, make something
that the vice chairwoman likes.

252
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,871
Yes, sir.

253
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:11,543
If you marry Kang-su,
you can be vice chairwoman.

254
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,837
Build up the company

255
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,924
and pass it on to our precious morula.

256
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:28,685
I bet the morula will be sharp as a tack,
just like your brother.

257
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:32,064
You'll run MZ Group for the next 30 years,

258
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:35,025
and then the morula
will take over for another 30.

259
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,236
Does that sound fair?

260
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,488
I'm not marrying Kang-su.

261
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:43,116
I'm offering you
the next 30 years of MZ Group as a gift.

262
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,204
Sir, Dr. Kang Kang-su
is on the phone for you.

263
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,622
Oh, really?

264
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,540
Make it a video call so we can all talk.

265
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,713
<i>The chairman would like</i>
<i>to switch to video call.</i>

266
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,059
Have you frozen them?

267
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:13,146
-<i>Mr. Chairman.</i>
-The portable freezer I gave Ryong

268
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,148
was specially designed

269
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:18,902
to block radiation and harmful rays,

270
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:22,531
<i>and it can easily pass through</i>
<i>the Earth's atmosphere.</i>

271
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,575
Take it from Ryong
and bring the morulas back in it.

272
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:30,163
Impressive, don't you think?

273
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,375
<i>The IOU could learn</i>
<i>a thing or two from us.</i>

274
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:36,795
I'm sorry.

275
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,172
What?

276
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,841
<i>The seven morulas…</i>

277
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,345
have all been destroyed.

278
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:48,890
What?

279
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,102
What are you talking about?

280
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,770
What do you mean?

281
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,605
Did you get caught?

282
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,358
<i>It's over.</i>

283
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:00,777
How much do they know?

284
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,363
What about Ryong? Is he okay?

285
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,327
I lied and said the eggs
were donated for experiments,

286
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,204
<i>so they don't know</i>
<i>they were Dr. Na's eggs.</i>

287
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,501
You were so sure of yourself!

288
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,254
Did you lose the rest of the eggs too?

289
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,341
Gong Ryong still has a few of them,

290
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:24,968
<i>but I can't use the microscope.</i>

291
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,304
<i>It's been moved to the main module</i>

292
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,723
<i>and locked up in a rack.</i>

293
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:33,018
It's under 24-7 CCTV surveillance,
and nothing can be done in secret.

294
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,271
There's nothing I can do.

295
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:37,189
<i>Are you…</i>

296
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,983
Are you telling me to give up right now?

297
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:43,695
<i>There's no other option. I'm sorry.</i>

298
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,158
Who did it?

299
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,328
Who killed my grandchild?

300
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,496
Who is it?

301
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,206
Your commander?

302
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,501
Dad!

303
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,835
I'll call you later.

304
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,504
Sir.

305
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,048
Dad.

306
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,383
CHAIRMAN CHOI JAE-RYONG

307
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,229
They didn't even get to live for a day.

308
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:20,941
-Who did this?
-Dad.

309
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:24,486
Take him to the hospital now
before things get worse! Hurry!

310
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,488
-Dad!
-Bring them to me, damn it!

311
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,199
I'm going to kill
all those bastards up there!

312
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:32,327
I'm going to kill them!

313
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,462
-Father.
-Sir, are you all right?

314
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,505
-Dad!
-Father.

315
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,923
Stay with me, sir.

316
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,927
Dad, we're almost there.
Just hang in there, okay?

317
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,178
Dad.

318
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:01,439
{\an8}FLAVORS OF THE MOUNTAIN, SEA, AND SKY

319
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,614
Hey, it's raining.

320
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:10,866
Oh, goodness!

321
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,661
I wish it had started raining sooner.

322
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:17,372
The weather's perfect
for mung bean pancakes and <i>makgeolli.</i>

323
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:21,501
Rainy days make me think of my exes.

324
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,132
I wonder if our Ryong
is eating well up there.

325
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,051
Ryong!

326
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,237
What a jerk, right?

327
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,323
Kang Kang-su.

328
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:59,956
I know you have his lottery ticket.
The one that won the jackpot last year.

329
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,425
I'll talk with Santi
before he goes back in three days.

330
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:13,553
How about we split it three ways?

331
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:19,142
Someone like Kang-su
doesn't deserve that money.

332
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,020
He's not even on the team anymore.

333
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:37,702
What… What about my sister?

334
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,749
You've got a month to claim it.

335
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,210
Santi is the only one
who can do it in time.

336
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,378
You found the ticket,

337
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,505
I'm the only one who can convince him,

338
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:51,591
and Santi is the one who can go
to Houston and collect the cash.

339
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,302
But your sister?

340
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,222
She's not doing anything.

341
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:03,645
In…

342
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:08,817
In any case…

343
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:13,738
In any case, let's split it four ways.

344
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,227
Dad.

345
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:51,526
I know it's hard,
but you have to accept it.

346
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,405
Let's call Ryong.

347
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:58,950
Please stop.

348
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,536
Min-jeong, call Ryong.

349
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:04,831
He still has three eggs.

350
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,084
That ICSI microscope.

351
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,796
Tell him to steal it if he has to.

352
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:16,092
He might get caught too if he does that.
What then?

353
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,345
Min-jeong, call Ryong.

354
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,890
He'll listen to you.

355
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,017
Call Ryong.

356
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,227
-Father.
-Do it now.

357
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:29,647
Kang-su said
they can't do it because of the cameras!

358
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:34,527
There's no way it can be done
without a microscope.

359
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,863
-It's over.
-Shut it.

360
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,281
We…

361
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,409
should give up.

362
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,911
I'm not giving up.

363
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,539
I won't.

364
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:51,669
If you don't stop, you'll get Ryong
and all of us in serious trouble.

365
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,046
Please.

366
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,841
Please come to your senses, Dad!

367
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,677
Please…

368
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:22,826
There are only three eggs left now.

369
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,911
<i>I have to succeed tonight, no matter what.</i>

370
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,580
<i>I'm going back in three days,</i>

371
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,833
and they'll need three days
to become morulas.

372
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:31,709
Tonight's my last chance.

373
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,129
Turn left, please.

374
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,843
Give it up.
You don't even have a microscope.

375
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:44,222
I did get a couple of pipettes
from the biological module.

376
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:47,851
<i>Hey, what are you going to do</i>
<i>with just the pipettes?</i>

377
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,145
<i>You still need a microscope</i>
<i>to attach them to</i>

378
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:54,691
for one to hold the egg
and the other to inject sperm.

379
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:57,068
It's like a needle without the syringe.

380
00:28:57,152 --> 00:29:00,113
Really? I had no idea.
Thanks for telling me, buddy.

381
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,823
-<i>You jerk.</i>
-Hey, that's cute.

382
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:06,077
How can I turn myself into a microscope?

383
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,620
<i>You can't.</i>

384
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,665
For God's sake.

385
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,216
This damn zero gravity.

386
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,470
I thought it'd work
if someone held on to my legs.

387
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:26,431
Hey, since you don't have a microscope,

388
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:31,728
why not get someone to hold
each of your legs and arms?

389
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,481
Yeah, get four people to hold you still.

390
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,691
<i>Go make an announcement.</i>

391
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,778
<i>"Hi, I'm trying IVF again."</i>

392
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,029
<i>"Can somebody hold me up?"</i>

393
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,532
-Hold on.
-<i>"Who wants to help me? Raise your hand!"</i>

394
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,576
Hey, wait. Be quiet.

395
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:50,413
<i>Dude, if you pull this off</i>
<i>without a microscope,</i>

396
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,248
<i>I'll give you a Nobel Prize myself.</i>

397
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,212
<i>It's impossible</i>
<i>without a microscope, Ryong.</i>

398
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:01,716
Hey!

399
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,844
He keeps disappearing
in the middle of calls.

400
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,307
Where am I?

401
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:11,893
What do you mean,
all we have to do is hold his legs?

402
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,479
What'll the tourist do
if we hold his legs?

403
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:16,564
He won't say.

404
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,109
What, does he think we're stupid?

405
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,654
Why should we hold him
if he doesn't tell us what he's gonna do?

406
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:26,282
We're gonna do it no matter what, okay?

407
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:30,745
We hold his legs, we get 500 billion.

408
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,330
Sweet deal, right?

409
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:34,290
Let's do it.

410
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:39,921
Should we call him?

411
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:03,653
<i>Spacewalk suits don't have any joints,</i>
<i>so we move really slowly.</i>

412
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:08,825
Moving even 0.00001 mm makes your heart
feel like it's about to burst.

413
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,703
<i>It's like dying in a jointless prison.</i>

414
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,211
What are you doing?

415
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:25,008
Come with me for a second.

416
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,845
Is it impossible to move in this?

417
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,388
Pretty much.

418
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,432
Why?

419
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:53,161
We'll keep your legs still and secure,

420
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,704
so keep your promise.

421
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:56,789
Of course.

422
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,835
I won't say a word about it.
I'll take it to my grave.

423
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:03,671
No.

424
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,967
I want to know
why you need us to hold your legs.

425
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:09,594
I need to know.

426
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:14,015
I don't care if the prize
is 500 billion or 5 trillion.

427
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:16,559
In pari delicto.

428
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,813
You want us to dance,
you gotta show us your hand.

429
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:31,866
I will do the same thing
that Kang Kang-su did.

430
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,951
What the…

431
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,994
-What?
-What did you just say?

432
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:36,871
Santi.

433
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,249
What Kang Kang-su said
back there was a lie.

434
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,334
It's not your sperm.

435
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:43,086
Fuck!

436
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:46,381
It was my patient's sperm,
as crooked as yours.

437
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,177
I came up to space
at the request of a mother

438
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,804
who desperately wanted a baby.

439
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:56,432
Because her husband's sperm
have a genetic defect,

440
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,726
it would be impossible to get pregnant

441
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,020
if it wasn't for zero gravity here.

442
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,315
No matter what baby is born,

443
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,984
a responsible mother

444
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,903
who will raise the baby with love,

445
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,197
is waiting.

446
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:13,741
This is insane!

447
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,327
I'm out.

448
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,037
I can't do it.

449
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,164
Didn't you see what happened to Dr. Kang?

450
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,251
You're basically asking us
to risk our lives here.

451
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,504
We could easily lose our jobs
as astronauts like Kang-su did.

452
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:29,132
I'm not asking you
to do the procedure yourselves.

453
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,759
Just hold my legs down
like when I operated on the mouse.

454
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,720
I'll turn a blind eye
to the lottery ticket,

455
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:37,015
if you guys will turn a blind eye
to what I'm about to do.

456
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:39,517
No, I'm not doing this.

457
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,893
Me neither.

458
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,687
Are you kidding me?

459
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:47,150
So you'll just give up the 500 billion?

460
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:55,950
Okay.

461
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:59,412
Let's say we do it.
What about the ICSI microscope?

462
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:04,125
Mr. Gong, you can't perform an ICSI
without a microscope.

463
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:08,504
When you move your hand by one centimeter
with the joystick and manipulator,

464
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:11,758
the needle only moves by one micrometer.

465
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,801
Is it really impossible?

466
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:17,930
If you hold my legs completely still,

467
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:20,808
I will…

468
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,187
I'll turn my body into a microscope.

469
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,491
There you go.

470
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,038
I thought space was like a womb,

471
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,665
but it's a tomb, isn't it?

472
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,542
Not a place of creation…

473
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:49,295
but a place of death?

474
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,636
<i>He was at death's door, but he made it.</i>

475
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,971
Look at this guy gobbling up the food.

476
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,933
He seems to be back to full health.
What do we do now?

477
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:05,728
<i>Eve.</i>

478
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:07,730
What?

479
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:09,690
Yeah, I know.

480
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,526
<i>He's eating like a champ.</i>

481
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,819
And pooping like one too.

482
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,154
Yeah. Lucky little guy, right?

483
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:16,823
<i>He's doing really well today.</i>

484
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,199
Right?

485
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,617
<i>Should we try pairing him up?</i>

486
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,245
<i>He's probably over his mate</i>
<i>back on Earth by now.</i>

487
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,539
Yeah? Which one should we pair him with?

488
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,584
Let's see. Who's the best…

489
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,212
Who's the best match?

490
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:40,721
When Male Mouse 1 was
still hung up on his mate on Earth,

491
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,559
was there any particular female mouse
he had trouble with?

492
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,564
Well…

493
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,483
Yeah, this one. Female Mouse 3.

494
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,653
Male Mouse 1 bit her pretty badly.

495
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,446
So, I guess not her.

496
00:35:58,614 --> 00:35:59,866
She's the perfect match.

497
00:35:59,949 --> 00:36:01,450
I told you, he bit her.

498
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,912
It's probably
because she kept coming on to him

499
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,415
while he was still
heartbroken over his mate.

500
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:11,002
That means Female Mouse 3

501
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,130
was the most forward with him.

502
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,133
Are you sure?

503
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,719
Same goes for humans, right?

504
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:25,016
When it comes to sex and pregnancy,

505
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,851
I'm the expert.

506
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,519
<i>He's right.</i>

507
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,522
<i>Mouse 3 did throw herself at him.</i>
<i>I saw it.</i>

508
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:38,070
You saw how the fruit fly
gave birth in front of me.

509
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,531
They must've known an ob-gyn was watching.

510
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:44,452
I'm telling you.
They can sense who I am instinctively.

511
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,797
Okay, I'll trust you on this then.

512
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,054
Okay. Come here, girl.

513
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,388
All right.

514
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:07,725
-<i>Commander.</i>
-Be gentle.

515
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,769
<i>I guess we have a long night ahead of us.</i>

516
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:23,426
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

517
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:26,929
<i>Happy birthday, dear Min-jeong</i>

518
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:29,098
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

519
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,309
<i>Ready? One, two, three.</i>

520
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:33,686
<i>All right.</i>

521
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,522
<i>Thank you. I love you.</i>

522
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:38,733
<i>Let's be happy. Love you.</i>

523
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,734
<i>Love you too.</i>

524
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,445
<i>Thank you, Dong-hun.</i>

525
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,103
Let's do it.

526
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,229
I wanna hold his legs.

527
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,688
Screw space law.

528
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,109
Santi.

529
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:06,237
A mother's waiting for her child.

530
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,488
It's a loving couple.

531
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,742
Plus, I can claim the prize
when I get back to Earth in three days.

532
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,119
Let's do it.

533
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,414
My heart withers in space.

534
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,666
It becomes smaller and smaller.

535
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,001
It might just disappear.

536
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,670
I can't do it.

537
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:36,308
Fine.

538
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,478
You two stay here.
I'll help Mr. Gong all by myself.

539
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:43,274
You know, every day
I look at all these girls

540
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,192
again and again

541
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,736
to collect semen samples
to send back to Earth

542
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,822
all because I want to have children.

543
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,993
It's the same thing with Fantasia.
What's the difference?

544
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,412
I'm tired of looking
at these damn magazines.

545
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,916
I know my wife would love this.

546
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,429
I know Emma would want me
to help Mr. Gong.

547
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,201
I don't understand.

548
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,369
Why isn't he here yet?

549
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,830
Wow, he got everything ready.

550
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,752
Jesus!

551
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,216
Santi, Dr. Lee.

552
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:56,096
What are you doing in that?

553
00:41:56,972 --> 00:41:58,974
You can barely move in that suit.

554
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:01,852
-It makes you really slow.
-Exactly.

555
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,896
If I wear this,

556
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:06,774
my hands will be slow
when I move the pipettes, right?

557
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:11,695
When I move one centimeter,
I actually move one micrometer.

558
00:42:13,113 --> 00:42:15,241
Wow.

559
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,662
Hey, where's Mina?

560
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,671
Ladies! Wake up already.

561
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:37,388
Goodness.
I knew you were drinking too much.

562
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,851
I ground the mung beans.
You prepare the chives.

563
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,729
{\an8}<i>Kim Je-deok faces off against</i>
<i>number one in the world, Brazil's…</i>

564
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,131
Oh, my gosh. I have to tell him.

565
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,508
Mr. Gong.

566
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,229
Where is he? Hello?

567
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,275
Where did he go?

568
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:42,953
How about now?

569
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:45,247
Is it still shaking?

570
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,671
They're much steadier now.

571
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,465
Good, just like that.

572
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:04,016
Ladies, let's eat rice with fried eggs
and the side dishes we have for breakfast.

573
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,267
-Sounds good.
-Okay.

574
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:08,979
<i>Kim seems to be in great shape today,</i>
<i>and his balance looks excellent.</i>

575
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,418
{\an8}-<i>Ten points!</i>
-Ten points.

576
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,504
<i>He's off to a great start.</i>
<i>He's in top form…</i>

577
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,881
-Wow.
-He got the sperm.

578
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:39,343
You really are a human microscope.
It's amazing.

579
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:43,514
Now, I'll hold the egg with the pipette.

580
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:47,101
At least the egg is bigger.

581
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:14,711
-Come on.
-Come on.

582
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:18,215
You're good at everything else,
but you suck at frying eggs.

583
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:19,591
-Switch with me.
-You do it.

584
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,346
Oh, we're all gonna die.

585
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:26,932
But you barely moved your hand.

586
00:45:27,015 --> 00:45:29,101
How could the pipette shake so much?

587
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:31,103
The first egg is dead.

588
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,898
We only have two more left.

589
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:37,317
Let's try again.

590
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,050
You did it! <i>Toma!</i>

591
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,596
I'm going to have a heart attack.

592
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,475
Now, this is the real deal.

593
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:14,146
I'm injecting the sperm…

594
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,566
into the egg.

595
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:21,320
All right. Let's eat.

596
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,238
<i>Kim needs to take a moment</i>

597
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,741
-to gauge the wind and compose himself.
-Yes.

598
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:29,036
His left arm holding the bow
must stay as still as a block of metal.

599
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,329
It cannot move.

600
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:33,457
He's holding steady,
thinking about the position and direction.

601
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,918
<i>If he keeps this up, he can do it.</i>

602
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,461
<i>I know he will.</i>

603
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:40,339
Hold steady, keep the tension,
and stay focused until the end.

604
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:42,591
<i>Now, he needs to take a bold shot.</i>

605
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:04,696
Oh, seven points!

606
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,822
-Shoot.
-Oh, man.

607
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,577
The sperm is outside the egg.

608
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:12,913
My goodness, the second egg died too?

609
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,122
I have to

610
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:17,960
inject the sperm right into the middle…

611
00:47:18,835 --> 00:47:20,754
Right into the middle of the egg.

612
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,521
Oh, Mina.

613
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,607
Have you seen Mr. Gong?

614
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,280
Okay! He got the sperm.

615
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,413
One egg left. Let's do it.

616
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,669
Mr. Gong?

617
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:05,757
No, I haven't seen
Mr. Gong anywhere, Commander!

618
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:06,967
No?

619
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:10,387
Commander.

620
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:18,562
Why would Mr. Gong be there, Commander?

621
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:33,744
Commander.

622
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,169
Have you seen the tourist?

623
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,341
Nope. Maybe he's gone home
since you've been so harsh on him.

624
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,898
Why are you guys up so late?

625
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,904
Well, I'm just checking, and he's packing

626
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:10,364
since we're going home soon.

627
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,492
Checking and packing this late?

628
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,410
Yup.

629
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,719
Have you guys been drinking again?

630
00:49:37,516 --> 00:49:39,142
I'm onto you, you know.

631
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,186
I'll find it.

632
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,778
Farewell drink or something, huh?

633
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:58,787
I let it slide once, but not twice.

634
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,580
I know it was you.

635
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,962
You can drink anytime
when you get back, Santi.

636
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,428
Commander!

637
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:19,725
Commander!

638
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,195
Yeah, you're right.

639
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:34,698
Booze? Yeah, we had some.

640
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:39,536
We know it's not allowed,
but we were feeling so lonely and tired.

641
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:43,165
We just took one shot.
I'm sorry. We shouldn't have.

642
00:50:43,248 --> 00:50:47,461
It's just that the station feels so cold.

643
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:51,757
But I know you're going to make this place

644
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,092
nice and warm.

645
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:56,928
I believe in you.

646
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,286
Where the hell did he go
this late at night?

647
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:26,082
Everyone, go to sleep.

648
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,793
-Now.
-Okay.

649
00:51:28,376 --> 00:51:29,669
Good night.

650
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,261
You guys are killing me!

651
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:40,806
I'm glad you're here, Mina.

652
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,808
Good job, Mina!

653
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:01,201
Where is he?

654
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:22,472
They look like they might actually do it.

655
00:52:33,108 --> 00:52:33,984
Oh, my gosh.

656
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:35,861
Oh, my gosh!

657
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:45,495
No way.
You somehow managed to get the sperm.

658
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:52,127
But even if you did,

659
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:56,256
are you sure you can inject the sperm
straight into the egg

660
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,342
with those thick gloves on?
They're smaller than a speck of dust.

661
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:13,231
I can if you'll help me.

662
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:20,947
So you're saying,
instead of moving the pipette,

663
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:25,452
you'll move the egg
with the culture medium

664
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:30,165
and align it with the tip of the pipette?

665
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:33,335
Yes, place it in a straight line
between the pipettes.

666
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:35,879
In a straight line.

667
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:39,925
Stop.

668
00:53:51,311 --> 00:53:54,189
The egg is aligning
in the center of the culture medium.

669
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,359
If you breathe, the droplet will move.

670
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:00,028
This is the last egg.

671
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:03,323
The sperm has to go

672
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:05,909
right into the middle of the egg.

673
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:07,953
Everyone.

674
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:11,581
I need you to hold your breath.

675
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:13,792
Hold your breath.

676
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:15,168
Okay.

677
00:54:16,169 --> 00:54:17,253
One.

678
00:54:18,046 --> 00:54:19,130
Two.

679
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:20,799
Three.

680
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:44,698
<i>Now, this is his final shot.</i>

681
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,992
Kim Je-deok
must believe in himself until the end.

682
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:50,036
Yes, he should stay focused
until the last moment. He can do this.

683
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,247
That's right. It's his last arrow!

684
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,331
<i>Stay calm.</i>

685
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,084
<i>You got this.</i>

686
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:03,466
<i>Off it goes!</i>

687
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,501
I…

688
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:42,005
am going to save you no matter what.

689
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:22,003
-<i>Bull's-eye!</i>
-Ten points!

690
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:24,297
-Ten points!
-He's amazing!

691
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:30,095
<i>It was a perfect shot! Just incredible!</i>

692
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:33,431
<i>Kim Je-deok stayed calm under pressure</i>
<i>until the very end…</i>

693
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:36,142
Damn!

694
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:42,941
Holy cow!

695
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:44,442
How is this possible?

696
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:49,572
You're so…

697
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:52,075
I'm starting to get scared of you.

698
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:54,869
It's all up to you now.

699
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,040
You can do it.

700
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:01,853
Where have you been?

701
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:03,771
Come here, quickly.

702
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:14,199
Do you hear that?

703
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:17,368
It's the male singing to court the female.

704
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:18,912
Can you hear his serenade? Come on.

705
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:29,339
What sound

706
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:32,050
did you say this was?

707
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,719
It's the male courting the female.

708
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,974
It's pretty loud.

709
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:41,643
I know, right?

710
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:01,913
Think they'll do it now?

711
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:04,707
What?

712
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:42,245
{\an8}GUEST APPEARANCE BY KIM JE-DEOK

713
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:52,797
GONG RYONG'S 6TH DAY

714
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:01,723
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

715
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,518
{\an8}<i>When we're back on Earth</i>
<i>and standing on solid ground,</i>

716
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:08,855
{\an8}<i>let's go out for meals, movies,</i>

717
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:11,316
{\an8}and walks, just like everyone else.

718
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,152
{\an8}<i>This doesn't feel right.</i>

719
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,905
{\an8}I'm going to do whatever it takes
to bring you a morula.

720
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:18,906
{\an8}<i>You're lying.</i>

721
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,950
{\an8}-Just with your hands? No way.
-Dr. Kang!

722
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:22,660
{\an8}<i>Kang Kang-su, you son of a bitch!</i>

723
01:00:24,078 --> 01:00:25,788
{\an8}<i>Oh! Look at this!</i>

724
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,790
{\an8}<i>The tourist is trapped</i>
<i>in the observation module alone?</i>

725
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:29,834
{\an8}-I'm still here!
-<i>Close the hatch right now!</i>

726
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,754
<i>I am not leaving him here alone!</i>

727
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:38,926
