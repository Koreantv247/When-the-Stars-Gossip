EPISODE 08

12
00:01:13,368 --> 00:01:14,202
What?

13
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:18,498
No. Don't come out.

14
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:19,832
Stay there!

15
00:01:23,461 --> 00:01:25,129
No, I deserve to die.

16
00:01:25,922 --> 00:01:28,341
Please go back.

17
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:31,511
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

18
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,763
Go back, Eve!

19
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,015
Go back!

20
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:46,943
<i>We're ready to go.
Commander, take your seat.</i>

21
00:01:47,819 --> 00:01:49,153
I'm not leaving.

22
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:50,989
<i>What?</i>

23
00:01:51,072 --> 00:01:52,865
I said, I'm not leaving.

24
00:01:55,535 --> 00:01:57,370
If it were me trapped alone,

25
00:01:57,996 --> 00:02:00,623
would you guys have left me behind?

26
00:02:00,707 --> 00:02:03,459
If I were the tourist,
would you have abandoned me?

27
00:02:04,043 --> 00:02:06,963
Being the commander doesn't mean
you have to throw your life away.

28
00:02:07,463 --> 00:02:09,841
Are you saying it's okay for him to die?

29
00:02:09,924 --> 00:02:12,260
Chief, would you have left me behind?

30
00:02:14,846 --> 00:02:17,932
Dong-a, would you have abandoned
an untrained civilian?

31
00:02:18,015 --> 00:02:19,100
<i>No, right?</i>

32
00:02:22,145 --> 00:02:24,147
I have the most experience
with spacewalks,

33
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,232
so I should be the one to stay.

34
00:02:26,315 --> 00:02:28,860
Reattach the hooks and open the hatch now.

35
00:02:28,943 --> 00:02:31,237
<i>I won't leave him alone here to die.</i>

36
00:02:33,322 --> 00:02:36,701
I'll find him and go back down with him
on a G.O ship.

37
00:02:38,035 --> 00:02:39,662
<i>I'm not throwing my life away.</i>

38
00:02:39,746 --> 00:02:42,874
I'll stick close to the station
and make my way over carefully.

39
00:02:43,666 --> 00:02:45,293
Open the hatch!

40
00:02:50,631 --> 00:02:53,050
<i>This is Seoul.
We have visual on EV1, Camera 5.</i>

41
00:02:53,885 --> 00:02:56,512
<i>EV1, don't rush it.
Just follow instructions.</i>

42
00:02:56,596 --> 00:02:58,848
<i>We're looking for the safest route.</i>

43
00:02:59,515 --> 00:03:00,516
Copy.

44
00:03:05,396 --> 00:03:06,564
This is EV1.

45
00:03:07,398 --> 00:03:10,026
I'll make my way up
from the kitchen module to Adapter 1,

46
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:14,113
the storage module, then Airlock 2.

47
00:03:23,873 --> 00:03:25,083
IOU.

48
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:29,170
Is there any other spot leaking oxygen
other than the storage module?

49
00:03:29,253 --> 00:03:31,297
We cannot confirm that right at this time.

50
00:03:33,174 --> 00:03:35,885
Are you saying
you don't know if the tourist is alive?

51
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:53,611
I've reached the storage module.

52
00:03:53,694 --> 00:03:56,030
The target point is visible 15 m ahead.

53
00:03:57,115 --> 00:04:00,076
There are a lot of sharp edges,
and the space debris will be back.

54
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:00,993
Be careful.

55
00:04:01,077 --> 00:04:02,203
Copy.

56
00:04:02,787 --> 00:04:04,205
Continuing on.

57
00:04:13,923 --> 00:04:14,924
No.

58
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:17,885
No!

59
00:04:30,106 --> 00:04:30,982
You're doing great.

60
00:04:31,065 --> 00:04:33,067
You're almost there.

61
00:04:40,116 --> 00:04:41,159
No.

62
00:04:42,618 --> 00:04:44,787
What? Is it back already?

63
00:04:44,871 --> 00:04:47,456
The debris cloud is approaching
faster than we thought.

64
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,374
It's speeding up.

65
00:04:52,545 --> 00:04:54,547
<i>Eve, hurry. The big ones are coming.</i>

66
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:55,923
Okay.

67
00:05:00,887 --> 00:05:02,180
<i>Incoming!</i>

68
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,682
<i>Eve, watch out!</i>

69
00:05:08,269 --> 00:05:09,562
No.

70
00:05:24,744 --> 00:05:26,704
Has her space suit been compromised?

71
00:05:27,288 --> 00:05:28,289
No, not yet.

72
00:05:29,582 --> 00:05:30,583
What?

73
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:32,543
What?

74
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,927
<i>Eve, take cover!</i>

75
00:06:36,524 --> 00:06:38,776
<i>When we're back on Earth
and standing on solid ground,</i>

76
00:06:39,694 --> 00:06:42,530
<i>let's go out for meals,</i>

77
00:06:43,406 --> 00:06:45,408
<i>movies and walks, just like everyone else.</i>

78
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:48,327
<i>If it rains, let's get wet</i>

79
00:06:48,411 --> 00:06:50,204
<i>and let the wind blow us over.</i>

80
00:06:51,747 --> 00:06:53,749
<i>Let's go on dates like they do on Earth.</i>

81
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:57,920
<i>When we get back, I'll be so good to you.</i>

82
00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:02,883
<i>Once I set foot on solid ground,</i>

83
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:05,553
I can be good to you too.

84
00:07:16,856 --> 00:07:18,190
<i>Don't look down!</i>

85
00:07:18,274 --> 00:07:20,109
Open your eyes and look straight ahead!

86
00:07:28,576 --> 00:07:30,661
- Check the pressure in her suit.
- Okay.

87
00:07:34,832 --> 00:07:38,002
There's no oxygen leak.
Her secondary tank's just been activated.

88
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:39,295
Okay. How are her vitals?

89
00:07:39,378 --> 00:07:41,630
Her temperature and heart rate
are still normal.

90
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:44,008
But there's no time.
She has to get inside now.

91
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:46,010
Eve, are you all right? Can you hear me?

92
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:47,720
<i>It's okay.</i>

93
00:07:47,803 --> 00:07:51,057
<i>There should be some scratches
on your suit, but nothing critical.</i>

94
00:08:11,786 --> 00:08:12,787
This is EV1.

95
00:08:15,122 --> 00:08:18,334
The cloud of debris is clearing.

96
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:19,627
<i>It'll be back!</i>

97
00:08:20,878 --> 00:08:23,381
Copy. I'll move fast.

98
00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:36,060
IOU.

99
00:08:36,894 --> 00:08:39,313
Have you gotten hold of the tourist yet?

100
00:08:39,397 --> 00:08:41,565
<i>Negative. Not yet.</i>

101
00:09:04,088 --> 00:09:05,589
I'm here.

102
00:09:05,673 --> 00:09:07,049
Right below the airlock hatch.

103
00:09:56,849 --> 00:09:59,977
What the hell was the tourist doing
in the observation module?

104
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,312
How is he? Is he okay?

105
00:10:01,395 --> 00:10:03,564
Stand by with the tourist, okay?

106
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,942
We'll confirm a safe time for your escape
on the G.O-4 and update you soon.

107
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:28,214
Airlock has been pressurized.

108
00:10:44,897 --> 00:10:46,148
Eve!

109
00:10:49,902 --> 00:10:50,903
I'm sorry.

110
00:10:51,445 --> 00:10:54,114
It's… It's my fault.

111
00:10:54,198 --> 00:10:56,492
It's all my fault.

112
00:11:08,462 --> 00:11:09,588
I'm sorry.

113
00:11:17,805 --> 00:11:18,931
Eve.

114
00:11:21,058 --> 00:11:22,059
Out of your suit yet?

115
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,854
You should've just left.

116
00:11:29,692 --> 00:11:30,901
Do you really mean that?

117
00:11:32,444 --> 00:11:33,779
You should've gone without me.

118
00:11:35,572 --> 00:11:37,032
I deserve it.

119
00:11:42,496 --> 00:11:44,456
I'm sorry for not making it there in time,

120
00:11:45,624 --> 00:11:47,209
for drinking behind your back,

121
00:11:48,002 --> 00:11:50,212
for calling you a murderer,

122
00:11:50,296 --> 00:11:52,548
for being here at all,
for having feelings for…

123
00:11:57,594 --> 00:12:01,640
For everything. I'm sorry for everything.

124
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:03,934
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

125
00:12:16,655 --> 00:12:18,282
You said you'd be good to me.

126
00:12:21,243 --> 00:12:25,331
You said you wanted to…
You know, like they do on Earth.

127
00:12:31,003 --> 00:12:33,422
Let's do that when we're back on Earth.

128
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:51,940
Eve, if you're out of your suit,
turn it around.

129
00:12:52,024 --> 00:12:53,150
Turn the camera around.

130
00:13:08,332 --> 00:13:09,333
<i>Eve.</i>

131
00:13:13,712 --> 00:13:14,838
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

132
00:13:30,729 --> 00:13:32,481
<i>Did we lose connection again?</i>

133
00:13:33,357 --> 00:13:35,234
<i>Eve?</i>

134
00:13:35,317 --> 00:13:37,486
<i>The connection seems fine,
but I can't hear her.</i>

135
00:13:41,615 --> 00:13:43,075
I'm sure they're fine.

136
00:13:43,158 --> 00:13:45,452
The connection is stable
and functioning properly.

137
00:13:45,536 --> 00:13:49,164
They've probably entered an area
with intermittent communication loss.

138
00:13:49,248 --> 00:13:50,082
I hope that's it.

139
00:13:50,165 --> 00:13:52,793
- When will we have the escape time?
- Right.

140
00:13:54,962 --> 00:13:55,879
<i>Breaking news.</i>

141
00:13:55,963 --> 00:13:59,925
<i>The Scorpion spacecraft made an emergency
escape after colliding with space debris</i>

142
00:14:00,008 --> 00:14:03,762
<i>and is now heading to Earth with
astronauts from Spain and Korea onboard.</i>

143
00:14:04,346 --> 00:14:08,600
<i>Fortunately, the Crew Scorpion
has a total capacity of six,</i>

144
00:14:09,101 --> 00:14:13,230
<i>and it's assumed the entire crew was able
to evacuate from the space station.</i>

145
00:14:13,731 --> 00:14:17,067
<i>Whether any astronauts remain
on the space station</i>

146
00:14:17,151 --> 00:14:19,111
<i>has yet to be confirmed.</i>

147
00:14:19,194 --> 00:14:21,572
<i>IOU and the Seoul Mission Control Center</i>

148
00:14:21,655 --> 00:14:24,074
<i>have announced they will brief the media</i>

149
00:14:24,158 --> 00:14:26,535
<i>on the emergency escape shortly.</i>

150
00:14:26,618 --> 00:14:29,121
- <i>Whether the tourist…</i>
- Mr. Go.

151
00:14:29,204 --> 00:14:32,416
<i>…is aboard the Scorpion
and returning a day early is unknown.</i>

152
00:14:32,499 --> 00:14:33,876
<i>As soon as we know more…</i>

153
00:14:37,629 --> 00:14:38,839
Well…

154
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,926
I'm sure he's fine, what with
all the advanced technology we have.

155
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:44,678
Don't worry, okay?

156
00:14:44,762 --> 00:14:48,015
You know Ryong.
I bet he's just lying there, relaxing…

157
00:14:48,098 --> 00:14:49,475
No, wait. He zonks out fast.

158
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,728
He's probably snoring like this
on his way back here now.

159
00:14:55,856 --> 00:14:57,399
- Should I go pick him up?
- Sorry?

160
00:14:57,483 --> 00:14:58,776
Can I come?

161
00:14:58,859 --> 00:15:00,110
I'll come too.

162
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:02,696
You really can't. You know that, right?

163
00:15:05,991 --> 00:15:07,493
We have our own airline.

164
00:15:08,076 --> 00:15:10,329
- Yes.
- Call and ask them to free up a plane.

165
00:15:10,412 --> 00:15:11,997
I didn't see him off when he left.

166
00:15:14,124 --> 00:15:17,294
You can't fly out right away,
and you'd never beat him there.

167
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:19,838
I don't need to beat him there.

168
00:15:19,922 --> 00:15:22,049
He's not coming straight to Seoul, right?

169
00:15:22,132 --> 00:15:26,136
You said he'd need a few days
to adjust to gravity at the hospital.

170
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,264
I can bring him back with me
on our plane after that.

171
00:15:30,432 --> 00:15:33,268
What are you waiting for?
Go make the call.

172
00:15:33,352 --> 00:15:35,729
But it takes time
to go through the procedures.

173
00:15:35,813 --> 00:15:36,897
Make it happen.

174
00:15:38,857 --> 00:15:39,858
Yes, ma'am.

175
00:15:43,028 --> 00:15:46,490
I wonder if the egg
developed into a morula before he set off.

176
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,428
GONG RYONG'S 8TH DAY

177
00:16:08,512 --> 00:16:10,597
MORULA FORMED

178
00:16:18,313 --> 00:16:21,191
The G.O-4 set for their escape
is functional in all modules,

179
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:23,610
and the propulsion control system
is working fine.

180
00:16:23,694 --> 00:16:25,112
Okay.

181
00:16:25,195 --> 00:16:28,699
It's been in hibernation mode,
so make sure it's fully powered up.

182
00:16:28,782 --> 00:16:31,410
The last step is the engine firing test.
Should we start?

183
00:16:32,035 --> 00:16:33,745
The liquid oxygen levels are dropping.

184
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:36,623
It looks like there's a leak.

185
00:16:37,374 --> 00:16:40,627
That means it could explode
when we fire up the engine.

186
00:16:40,711 --> 00:16:43,839
The oxygen saturation isn't that high,
so it shouldn't be a problem.

187
00:16:43,922 --> 00:16:45,424
We can start the engine.

188
00:16:45,507 --> 00:16:47,301
- Zoom in on the spacecraft.
- Okay.

189
00:17:09,114 --> 00:17:10,699
I don't see any leaks.

190
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:16,246
It's probably not showing up on camera.

191
00:17:16,330 --> 00:17:18,373
If the leak isn't visible,

192
00:17:18,457 --> 00:17:20,876
it should be fine to fire up the engine.

193
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,086
They can't avoid the debris
and return safely

194
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:25,339
unless we start the engine
and change the orbit.

195
00:17:25,422 --> 00:17:26,423
Right.

196
00:17:27,424 --> 00:17:28,967
I'm a little worried,

197
00:17:29,051 --> 00:17:31,929
but we can't let them board
without testing it first.

198
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,475
This is the only way for them to evacuate.

199
00:17:39,895 --> 00:17:41,355
Okay, start the test.

200
00:17:41,438 --> 00:17:42,397
Yes, Chief.

201
00:17:42,481 --> 00:17:44,775
Keep an eye on the liquid oxygen levels.

202
00:17:44,858 --> 00:17:46,610
- Check the saturation again too.
- Okay.

203
00:17:46,693 --> 00:17:48,779
They'll depart
as soon as the test is complete.

204
00:17:48,862 --> 00:17:49,863
Got it.

205
00:17:59,164 --> 00:18:02,250
They're doing the final test
on the spacecraft now.

206
00:18:02,334 --> 00:18:03,752
We'll depart in an hour.

207
00:18:03,835 --> 00:18:06,088
And in four hours, we'll be back on Earth.

208
00:18:31,571 --> 00:18:33,907
<i>You're not losing your mind
or anything, right?</i>

209
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,132
<i>You're not regretting it, are you?</i>

210
00:19:00,767 --> 00:19:01,935
<i>Am I dreaming?</i>

211
00:19:39,806 --> 00:19:43,143
THE TRUTH IS, I CAME HERE
TO CREATE EMBRYOS…

212
00:19:52,778 --> 00:19:56,740
Why does that damn oxygen tank
keep floating around? It's distracting.

213
00:20:04,623 --> 00:20:05,957
Are you in love with Eve?

214
00:20:10,962 --> 00:20:13,173
What? I was her mentor for five years.

215
00:20:16,384 --> 00:20:18,345
I was yours for five years.

216
00:20:24,726 --> 00:20:26,436
Crew Scorpion is entering the atmosphere.

217
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,357
Put the Scorpion on the main screen.

218
00:20:38,031 --> 00:20:39,616
<i>Scorpion has entered the atmosphere</i>

219
00:20:39,699 --> 00:20:41,576
and is expected to land in the open waters

220
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,995
off the coast of Florida
in 35 minutes as scheduled.

221
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,880
This is my first time riding Scorpion.

222
00:20:54,464 --> 00:20:58,051
I hope it's as safe as a G.O vessel.

223
00:21:01,555 --> 00:21:02,764
Scorpion?

224
00:21:02,848 --> 00:21:04,599
- Was that an explosion?
- Mina.

225
00:21:04,683 --> 00:21:05,851
Scorpion?

226
00:21:15,527 --> 00:21:17,320
Seoul? What was that?

227
00:21:17,404 --> 00:21:19,114
What was that?

228
00:21:19,197 --> 00:21:21,032
What's going on?

229
00:21:21,116 --> 00:21:22,367
Dona, what's happening?

230
00:21:25,162 --> 00:21:26,246
An explosion?

231
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,751
The escape ship's engine module
blew up during testing.

232
00:21:31,835 --> 00:21:33,170
Get G.O-4 on the screen.

233
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:35,338
Eve, are you all right?

234
00:21:35,422 --> 00:21:36,548
Mr. Gong Ryong?

235
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:39,968
Are you okay?

236
00:21:40,552 --> 00:21:42,137
I'm okay. Are you all right, Eve?

237
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,264
Close the airlock hatch first, Commander!

238
00:21:44,347 --> 00:21:45,974
The engine module exploded.

239
00:22:11,166 --> 00:22:12,709
<i>The truth is,</i>

240
00:22:12,792 --> 00:22:15,962
<i>I came here to create embryos
using the MZ Group heir's sperm</i>

241
00:22:16,046 --> 00:22:17,672
<i>and his wife's eggs.</i>

242
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,717
<i>I hid the eggs in the ice cream cup.</i>

243
00:22:21,885 --> 00:22:24,095
<i>I fertilized them behind your back,</i>

244
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:27,057
<i>and the embryo is now in the incubator.</i>

245
00:22:29,267 --> 00:22:30,393
<i>Please don't let it die.</i>

246
00:22:36,733 --> 00:22:39,569
<i>The engine module gave out
during the test and blew apart.</i>

247
00:22:42,155 --> 00:22:44,616
The remote power controls
aren't responding,

248
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,827
and the undocking system is down.

249
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:52,207
<i>It can't be detached from the station.</i>

250
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:55,085
The vessel is useless now.

251
00:22:57,337 --> 00:22:59,047
It won't get you back to Earth.

252
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:17,732
Eve.

253
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:21,695
What… What do we do now?

254
00:23:24,364 --> 00:23:25,740
There's nothing we can do.

255
00:23:35,502 --> 00:23:38,088
- <i>Go get my future son-in-law and grandkid.</i>
- This way.

256
00:23:38,172 --> 00:23:39,965
<i>Bring them both back safely.</i>

257
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,927
Yes, Chairman.

258
00:23:48,015 --> 00:23:50,809
The astronauts who escaped
have passed through the atmosphere.

259
00:23:57,316 --> 00:24:00,486
- Hello, there. It's good to see you.
- Did you have lunch?

260
00:24:02,112 --> 00:24:03,113
It's been a long time.

261
00:24:03,197 --> 00:24:04,907
- Hello.
- Hey.

262
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,872
Eve, here's the situation.

263
00:24:12,456 --> 00:24:14,875
<i>G.O-4, the only escape ship
available to you,</i>

264
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:16,502
<i>is no longer an option.</i>

265
00:24:17,377 --> 00:24:21,340
Right now, there's no way for you

266
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:23,133
<i>to get back to Earth.</i>

267
00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:25,928
How soon can you send a rescue ship?

268
00:24:26,428 --> 00:24:27,846
I'll look into it right away.

269
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:32,100
In the meantime, check the station's power
and see how long you can hold up.

270
00:24:32,184 --> 00:24:33,352
Copy.

271
00:25:07,094 --> 00:25:09,680
Commander,
is there anything I can do to help?

272
00:25:26,196 --> 00:25:28,282
Things are not looking good here.

273
00:25:28,991 --> 00:25:31,034
It seems the solar array got fried

274
00:25:31,118 --> 00:25:33,036
when the storage module was breached.

275
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:39,001
You've got to be kidding me.

276
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,880
<i>We can no longer get power
from the solar panels,</i>

277
00:25:43,672 --> 00:25:45,632
so we'll have to rely on emergency power.

278
00:25:45,716 --> 00:25:47,259
How long do you think it'll last?

279
00:25:48,302 --> 00:25:53,390
Well, I'd say no more than two days.

280
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:58,353
Then you need to conserve power.
Switch all modules to emergency mode.

281
00:25:58,437 --> 00:26:02,149
We'll keep communication open
until your space suit battery runs out.

282
00:26:02,232 --> 00:26:03,609
Let's keep it to a minimum.

283
00:26:04,693 --> 00:26:05,736
Got it.

284
00:26:05,819 --> 00:26:07,654
I'll start by turning off the systems

285
00:26:07,738 --> 00:26:10,073
that consume the most power,
except for life support.

286
00:26:11,533 --> 00:26:14,494
<i>We'll get to you in two days. We can.</i>

287
00:26:14,578 --> 00:26:15,954
We will.

288
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:20,626
The press is waiting.

289
00:26:24,046 --> 00:26:26,590
You need to speak to them
before the Scorpion lands,

290
00:26:26,673 --> 00:26:30,344
or they'll realize the commander
and the tourist couldn't evacuate.

291
00:26:31,511 --> 00:26:33,388
We need to shape the story on our end.

292
00:26:45,692 --> 00:26:47,027
Here she comes!

293
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,071
- Here she comes!
- Where?

294
00:26:49,738 --> 00:26:52,824
What caused the emergency evacuation
from the space station?

295
00:26:52,908 --> 00:26:55,118
Has everyone on the station
made it out safely?

296
00:26:55,202 --> 00:26:57,204
When is the tourist coming back to Korea?

297
00:26:57,287 --> 00:26:59,998
- Please give us an update.
- Could you give us the details?

298
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,793
When is the official…

299
00:27:10,175 --> 00:27:11,927
<i>It's become a morula.</i>

300
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,011
<i>Sixteen cells.</i>

301
00:27:14,763 --> 00:27:16,974
<i>I just need to bring it back
and implant it.</i>

302
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:37,703
Don't be scared, okay?

303
00:27:39,538 --> 00:27:40,872
We can get through this.

304
00:28:13,864 --> 00:28:17,117
We just need to hold out for two days
until they send the rescue ship.

305
00:28:19,202 --> 00:28:23,123
If we keep the power usage to a minimum,
we should be able to make it.

306
00:28:28,503 --> 00:28:29,796
But…

307
00:28:32,632 --> 00:28:36,053
<i>Once you turn off the dehumidifier,
condensation will start to form.</i>

308
00:28:36,136 --> 00:28:37,846
<i>That could be dangerous.</i>

309
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:41,808
So get here before we freeze to death.

310
00:29:03,705 --> 00:29:06,708
I'll make sure to get you back to Earth.

311
00:29:16,968 --> 00:29:18,220
Is there anything you need?

312
00:29:18,804 --> 00:29:20,263
No, thank you.

313
00:29:25,477 --> 00:29:26,311
We're ready to go.

314
00:29:27,562 --> 00:29:30,565
Please turn off your tablet
and all other electronic devices.

315
00:29:31,942 --> 00:29:32,984
Wait, look at this.

316
00:29:33,944 --> 00:29:34,778
What is it?

317
00:29:34,861 --> 00:29:37,823
<i>The emergency evacuation
from the space station was due to debris</i>

318
00:29:37,906 --> 00:29:40,951
created by the collision
of a fuel tank with a low-orbit satellite.

319
00:29:41,034 --> 00:29:44,037
Secondary impacts formed
a large cloud of debris,

320
00:29:44,121 --> 00:29:45,622
which was so vast that

321
00:29:45,705 --> 00:29:49,042
despite orbit adjustments,
it still intersected the station's path.

322
00:29:50,168 --> 00:29:52,796
<i>The escape ship has passed
through Earth's atmosphere</i>

323
00:29:52,879 --> 00:29:55,215
<i>and is heading to the waters
off Florida's coast.</i>

324
00:30:37,215 --> 00:30:38,258
Ocean.

325
00:30:40,469 --> 00:30:42,304
I feel terrible that we left them behind.

326
00:30:43,847 --> 00:30:45,640
When will they launch the rescue ship?

327
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:48,810
How are the commander and the tourist?
Are they okay?

328
00:30:55,275 --> 00:30:58,945
<i>The spacecraft that has arrived on Earth
is carrying a total of four people.</i>

329
00:30:59,654 --> 00:31:01,823
The mission commander and the tourist

330
00:31:01,907 --> 00:31:03,992
are currently still at the space station.

331
00:31:07,329 --> 00:31:10,707
<i>IOU and the Seoul Mission Control Center
are preparing a rescue ship</i>

332
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,126
<i>to evacuate the commander
and Mr. Gong Ryong</i>

333
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:15,670
<i>from the station as soon as possible.</i>

334
00:31:16,713 --> 00:31:19,466
<i>Due to the damage caused
by the space debris,</i>

335
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:22,928
- <i>they were left stranded on the station.</i>
- What is she saying, Dr. Jeon?

336
00:31:24,721 --> 00:31:27,224
- <i>They're in good health with no injuries.</i>
- I don't…

337
00:31:27,307 --> 00:31:29,851
- <i>They're maintaining communication…</i>
- I'm not sure.

338
00:31:29,935 --> 00:31:31,770
<i>…while awaiting the second evacuation.</i>

339
00:31:32,354 --> 00:31:36,566
<i>We plan to bring them back to Earth
as quickly as possible.</i>

340
00:31:38,443 --> 00:31:40,612
When and where
will the rescue ship launch?

341
00:31:40,695 --> 00:31:41,696
Who will board?

342
00:31:42,614 --> 00:31:43,615
That'll be all.

343
00:31:48,954 --> 00:31:51,248
I'm sorry.
We'll issue an official statement soon.

344
00:31:51,331 --> 00:31:53,959
- I'm sorry. Excuse me.
- Could you tell us more now?

345
00:32:06,888 --> 00:32:08,098
I'll go.

346
00:32:09,307 --> 00:32:12,477
The available vessels are
at IOU Mission Control and in the States.

347
00:32:12,561 --> 00:32:15,605
This isn't the time to get emotional.
Stay out of it.

348
00:32:16,815 --> 00:32:20,193
You know it's going to take
at least a week for them to launch.

349
00:32:20,277 --> 00:32:21,820
We can't wait that long.

350
00:32:21,903 --> 00:32:23,280
Let me take our own vessel.

351
00:32:24,948 --> 00:32:27,367
We don't have a vessel
that's completed a crewed flight.

352
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:30,954
The one we have
has never carried people into space.

353
00:32:31,037 --> 00:32:32,831
You know we're just testing

354
00:32:32,914 --> 00:32:35,584
the abort system and reentry
in two days with a manikin!

355
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:38,086
I'm saying, put me on it
instead of the manikin.

356
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:40,755
Isn't the manikin a stand-in
for a person anyway?

357
00:32:44,843 --> 00:32:45,844
Just get out of here.

358
00:32:48,805 --> 00:32:51,683
You're telling me to put you
on the test flight to see

359
00:32:51,766 --> 00:32:53,560
if it's safe enough to carry people?

360
00:32:53,643 --> 00:32:54,561
You're insane!

361
00:32:54,644 --> 00:32:57,897
They only have two days' worth of power
left on the space station.

362
00:32:57,981 --> 00:33:01,234
I'd rather die trying to reach them
than die from the stress of waiting.

363
00:33:01,318 --> 00:33:02,402
You just won't quit!

364
00:33:02,485 --> 00:33:03,862
I'm a pilot, all right?

365
00:33:03,945 --> 00:33:06,531
A soldier who's prepared
to die in the air any day.

366
00:33:06,615 --> 00:33:09,993
Are you going to let Eve die?
And send a rescue ship after she's dead?

367
00:33:10,076 --> 00:33:13,330
In this kind of situation, you should say,
"Man up and be the manikin."

368
00:33:13,413 --> 00:33:15,165
"You're a soldier. I'm your superior."

369
00:33:15,248 --> 00:33:16,666
"This is an order, you fucker!"

370
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:17,959
"You want to go? Fine, go!"

371
00:33:18,043 --> 00:33:19,419
Why can't you be like this?

372
00:33:22,047 --> 00:33:24,132
You think you want to save Eve
and I don't?

373
00:33:24,966 --> 00:33:27,886
You can't bring them back
if you don't make it there safely,

374
00:33:27,969 --> 00:33:29,846
you stupid womanizer!

375
00:33:31,056 --> 00:33:34,184
Have you ever seen
the manikin come back in one piece?

376
00:33:34,684 --> 00:33:37,103
Who do you think you are?
You don't even work here!

377
00:33:39,064 --> 00:33:40,523
I'm not quitting.

378
00:33:41,107 --> 00:33:42,734
My resignation hasn't been processed yet.

379
00:33:42,817 --> 00:33:44,486
You can just forget about it.

380
00:33:45,403 --> 00:33:47,072
I won't stand for it

381
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:49,282
if anyone hesitates to save Eve's life.

382
00:33:50,116 --> 00:33:51,576
Even if it's you.

383
00:34:05,173 --> 00:34:12,097
GONG RYONG'S 9TH DAY

384
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:08,570
It's minus 20 degrees.

385
00:35:09,779 --> 00:35:11,448
I found the thermal tents.

386
00:35:11,531 --> 00:35:12,657
Let's wait it out in these.

387
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:20,331
- I'm going to go see if there's any food.
- Okay.

388
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:31,259
As you all know,
the ILS system has been severely damaged,

389
00:35:31,342 --> 00:35:33,386
and we can't get
the automatic docking to work,

390
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:36,806
so the unmanned rescue ship is useless.

391
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:39,017
<i>We need to send astronauts
on the rescue ship.</i>

392
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,435
When can we do it?

393
00:35:40,935 --> 00:35:44,355
<i>We haven't even detached the engine
from the Scorpion yet.</i>

394
00:35:44,439 --> 00:35:45,940
<i>It will take at least a week.</i>

395
00:35:47,066 --> 00:35:47,942
Bongani.

396
00:35:48,526 --> 00:35:51,696
When is the earliest you can get
the G.O spaceship ready for launch?

397
00:35:55,116 --> 00:35:58,828
<i>The earliest I would be able to
get them ready would be five days.</i>

398
00:35:59,746 --> 00:36:01,706
Can you please move up three days?

399
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:05,585
<i>Isn't the Maru ready to launch
in two days?</i>

400
00:36:05,668 --> 00:36:07,712
<i>Has it done the return test yet?</i>

401
00:36:11,174 --> 00:36:13,676
This will be our first test with dummies.

402
00:36:14,302 --> 00:36:16,888
We didn't even finish
an emergency escape test.

403
00:36:35,448 --> 00:36:36,699
Water, guys.

404
00:36:41,955 --> 00:36:43,414
Can I get a water, please?

405
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:45,083
Please.

406
00:36:45,166 --> 00:36:47,627
Get me a bottle of water, you prick.

407
00:36:50,129 --> 00:36:51,130
Hello?

408
00:36:52,006 --> 00:36:54,300
Is there a Mr. Kang? Mr. Kang?

409
00:36:54,801 --> 00:36:55,885
Just a moment.

410
00:36:56,553 --> 00:36:57,720
Here. It's for you.

411
00:37:02,642 --> 00:37:04,185
Hello? This is Kang Kang-su.

412
00:37:04,269 --> 00:37:07,564
<i>Why did you come back alone?
Why is Ryong still up there?</i>

413
00:37:07,647 --> 00:37:11,192
<i>Why did you come back without him?
You bastard!</i>

414
00:37:11,776 --> 00:37:14,279
- Go-eun.
- <i>You go back up there right now</i>

415
00:37:14,362 --> 00:37:16,072
<i>and bring back Ryong!</i>

416
00:37:16,155 --> 00:37:17,323
All right.

417
00:37:18,449 --> 00:37:19,909
All right, listen.

418
00:37:23,413 --> 00:37:25,206
You have a plane in Houston, right?

419
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:30,587
WE ARE CLOSED

420
00:37:35,884 --> 00:37:36,885
Hey.

421
00:37:43,892 --> 00:37:45,059
Damn it.

422
00:37:55,695 --> 00:37:58,698
For God's sake!
Stop crying like it's his funeral!

423
00:37:58,781 --> 00:38:00,783
He's going to come back just fine!

424
00:38:00,867 --> 00:38:03,161
Your eyes are made for seeing,

425
00:38:03,244 --> 00:38:04,746
not for spilling damn tears.

426
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:06,080
Hey, come on.

427
00:38:08,499 --> 00:38:10,418
Damn it.

428
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,007
That jerk.

429
00:38:37,326 --> 00:38:41,330
EVE, GONG RYONG
STRANDED FOR 30 HOURS

430
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:44,750
<i>This is the space station.</i>

431
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,005
<i>We're running out of emergency power.</i>

432
00:38:51,299 --> 00:38:53,843
<i>Communication uses up the most power,</i>

433
00:38:54,385 --> 00:38:56,637
so if we keep charging the space suit,

434
00:38:57,513 --> 00:38:59,474
the life support system will shut down.

435
00:39:01,267 --> 00:39:03,478
I know we need to stay online for rescue,

436
00:39:04,228 --> 00:39:06,689
but we won't survive without oxygen,
so for now…

437
00:39:08,774 --> 00:39:11,235
I'll shut down everything

438
00:39:11,319 --> 00:39:14,530
except the CO2 scrubbers
and oxygen generators.

439
00:39:15,865 --> 00:39:18,159
<i>This is probably our last transmission.</i>

440
00:39:18,743 --> 00:39:20,912
<i>The tourist and I are holding on for now.</i>

441
00:39:21,913 --> 00:39:23,748
<i>We won't give up hope until the end.</i>

442
00:39:24,248 --> 00:39:26,918
IOU is doing everything it can
to speed things up.

443
00:39:27,001 --> 00:39:28,544
We'll be there in 24 hours.

444
00:39:29,754 --> 00:39:30,838
<i>Really?</i>

445
00:39:31,547 --> 00:39:32,548
Yeah.

446
00:39:35,593 --> 00:39:37,678
We'll launch within 30 hours max.

447
00:39:47,188 --> 00:39:48,272
<i>I…</i>

448
00:39:51,442 --> 00:39:52,443
I mean, we…

449
00:39:55,196 --> 00:39:57,782
Please don't give up on us, guys.

450
00:40:03,746 --> 00:40:05,122
<i>I'll see you back on Earth.</i>

451
00:40:15,466 --> 00:40:16,717
Commander.

452
00:40:16,801 --> 00:40:17,885
Eve.

453
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,376
How about a drink?

454
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,878
By the time IOU gets there,
they'll both be dead.

455
00:41:33,961 --> 00:41:35,379
Shut up.

456
00:41:35,463 --> 00:41:39,175
The Maru is set for launch tomorrow.
Instead of the manikin--

457
00:41:39,258 --> 00:41:40,509
I said, shut up.

458
00:41:40,593 --> 00:41:41,677
What's your plan then?

459
00:41:41,761 --> 00:41:44,513
Call Bongani
and tell him to get it done in 30 hours!

460
00:41:44,597 --> 00:41:47,642
Even if he does,
they'll both be dead in 30 hours!

461
00:41:47,725 --> 00:41:49,810
They'll suffocate to death
from the CO2 buildup

462
00:41:49,894 --> 00:41:51,145
and lack of oxygen!

463
00:41:51,228 --> 00:41:52,980
You know Eve. If she says two days,

464
00:41:53,064 --> 00:41:55,483
it means they've got less than that!

465
00:41:55,566 --> 00:41:57,068
What then?

466
00:41:57,652 --> 00:41:59,445
You want to let Dong-a go like he says?

467
00:41:59,528 --> 00:42:01,906
And tell yourselves,
"We did everything we could"?

468
00:42:02,531 --> 00:42:05,284
If we do that,
all three of them will die, you idiots!

469
00:42:06,535 --> 00:42:07,828
Damn it.

470
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,041
Shit.

471
00:42:15,378 --> 00:42:19,382
OXYGEN REMAINING IN STATION: 28%

472
00:42:19,465 --> 00:42:23,469
SURVIVAL TIME REMAINING:
APPROXIMATELY 20 HOURS

473
00:42:30,184 --> 00:42:32,561
God, it's cold.

474
00:42:35,106 --> 00:42:36,107
I'm cold.

475
00:42:49,704 --> 00:42:51,497
You think rescue will come tomorrow?

476
00:42:55,793 --> 00:42:57,837
Don't talk. Save your energy.

477
00:42:59,213 --> 00:43:00,631
Will they come?

478
00:43:06,762 --> 00:43:08,764
Why is time passing so slowly?

479
00:43:09,473 --> 00:43:11,851
Well, don't you have your cell phone?

480
00:43:11,934 --> 00:43:13,728
You can't go online,

481
00:43:13,811 --> 00:43:17,898
but don't you have
some music or videos saved?

482
00:43:20,693 --> 00:43:23,529
Where's my phone? I can't find it.

483
00:43:31,036 --> 00:43:32,747
I guess it's somewhere over there.

484
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:35,082
I'm freezing.

485
00:43:35,166 --> 00:43:36,000
Uh-huh.

486
00:43:37,752 --> 00:43:38,753
"Uh-huh"?

487
00:43:39,587 --> 00:43:40,629
Uh-huh.

488
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:44,258
Are formalities out the window now?

489
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:48,220
Let's just drop them.

490
00:43:48,971 --> 00:43:51,682
We're going to die soon anyway,
so who cares?

491
00:43:54,685 --> 00:43:55,895
Yeah.

492
00:43:57,271 --> 00:43:58,314
You're right.

493
00:43:59,106 --> 00:44:00,691
- Eve.
- Yeah?

494
00:44:00,775 --> 00:44:04,570
Where's the liquor? Are you going
to drink it after you freeze to death?

495
00:44:04,653 --> 00:44:07,990
I was saving it
for when we really need it.

496
00:44:08,824 --> 00:44:11,035
When we really can't take it anymore,

497
00:44:11,118 --> 00:44:14,079
and there's absolutely no choice.

498
00:44:14,163 --> 00:44:16,248
We're going to die
if you save it any longer.

499
00:44:18,083 --> 00:44:20,336
Stop saying we're going to die.

500
00:44:21,462 --> 00:44:23,297
Come on, let's just drink it.

501
00:44:23,964 --> 00:44:25,841
My feet have gone numb.

502
00:44:25,925 --> 00:44:27,801
They've gone numb already?

503
00:44:27,885 --> 00:44:28,969
Yeah.

504
00:44:30,054 --> 00:44:31,096
Hang on.

505
00:44:35,226 --> 00:44:36,227
Here.

506
00:44:44,276 --> 00:44:46,070
Oh, geez.

507
00:44:54,703 --> 00:44:55,704
How is it?

508
00:44:59,166 --> 00:45:00,834
God, that's good.

509
00:45:02,169 --> 00:45:03,003
Here.

510
00:45:14,557 --> 00:45:15,808
- How is it?
- It burns.

511
00:45:16,517 --> 00:45:17,518
Feels good, right?

512
00:45:25,609 --> 00:45:26,860
Oh, that's nice.

513
00:45:32,324 --> 00:45:34,410
I'd kill for a movie right now.

514
00:45:34,493 --> 00:45:36,870
A movie would be great.

515
00:45:47,131 --> 00:45:51,135
Let's go see one when we're back on Earth.

516
00:45:53,178 --> 00:45:54,221
Together.

517
00:45:58,601 --> 00:45:59,852
Together?

518
00:46:01,395 --> 00:46:02,521
Yeah.

519
00:46:21,290 --> 00:46:22,333
Eve.

520
00:46:23,125 --> 00:46:24,126
Yeah?

521
00:46:29,632 --> 00:46:30,507
Never mind.

522
00:46:31,842 --> 00:46:33,218
What is it?

523
00:46:35,137 --> 00:46:36,305
If I'm about to die,

524
00:46:37,431 --> 00:46:38,932
can I be forgiven for anything?

525
00:46:39,516 --> 00:46:43,270
What's the point of forgiveness?
Once you're dead, it's all over.

526
00:46:43,937 --> 00:46:46,273
For some things,
you'd still want forgiveness.

527
00:46:49,485 --> 00:46:50,778
Like what?

528
00:46:55,532 --> 00:46:56,533
Like…

529
00:47:01,288 --> 00:47:02,581
Nothing, never mind.

530
00:47:14,343 --> 00:47:17,054
Let's get some rest now.

531
00:47:17,888 --> 00:47:19,306
I should stretch my legs.

532
00:47:22,059 --> 00:47:23,686
What's wrong? Are you in pain?

533
00:47:25,187 --> 00:47:26,188
What's the matter?

534
00:47:27,398 --> 00:47:29,733
I have a cramp. It's really bad.

535
00:47:29,817 --> 00:47:32,903
What? You… You have a cramp?

536
00:47:32,986 --> 00:47:33,987
Yeah.

537
00:47:34,488 --> 00:47:35,614
Hold on a second.

538
00:47:39,034 --> 00:47:40,244
- No, don't come out!
- No.

539
00:47:40,327 --> 00:47:42,246
- Stay there!
- No.

540
00:47:43,163 --> 00:47:44,707
Oh, it's bad.

541
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:45,916
Stay there!

542
00:47:45,999 --> 00:47:47,501
No, don't! It's dangerous!

543
00:47:47,584 --> 00:47:48,794
No, wait!

544
00:47:50,212 --> 00:47:51,964
Which leg, the left one?

545
00:47:52,047 --> 00:47:53,090
It hurts.

546
00:47:54,049 --> 00:47:56,051
Where? Here?

547
00:47:56,135 --> 00:47:57,219
Yeah.

548
00:47:59,346 --> 00:48:01,598
Your leg is freezing.

549
00:48:01,682 --> 00:48:04,601
Go back in.
It's not safe outside the tent. Go!

550
00:48:04,685 --> 00:48:06,019
You'll put yourself in danger.

551
00:48:08,731 --> 00:48:09,565
What?

552
00:48:09,648 --> 00:48:12,860
Well, you said
it's not safe outside the tent.

553
00:48:15,487 --> 00:48:16,447
Bad idea?

554
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:19,491
No.

555
00:48:37,509 --> 00:48:38,594
Come here.

556
00:48:45,684 --> 00:48:47,394
Isn't this a little better?

557
00:48:54,026 --> 00:48:55,652
- You know…
- Yeah?

558
00:48:57,362 --> 00:48:59,740
It'd actually be warmer if we were naked.

559
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,746
Are you okay with that?

560
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,749
We might actually die.

561
00:49:08,832 --> 00:49:11,126
It's not a matter
of whether I'm okay with it.

562
00:49:19,051 --> 00:49:21,970
- Can I have the liquor?
- Yeah.

563
00:49:23,722 --> 00:49:25,057
Do you want some?

564
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:26,475
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

565
00:49:49,498 --> 00:49:50,582
Get your arm out first.

566
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:05,305
Your body feels ice cold.

567
00:50:06,473 --> 00:50:07,474
Yeah.

568
00:50:12,145 --> 00:50:14,857
I'll warm you up.

569
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:18,151
Just hang on.
You'll feel warm in a minute.

570
00:50:18,235 --> 00:50:19,236
Okay.

571
00:50:23,949 --> 00:50:24,992
Are you warm?

572
00:50:27,911 --> 00:50:28,745
Yeah.

573
00:50:30,664 --> 00:50:32,958
You must be out of your mind.
You're the commander.

574
00:50:34,793 --> 00:50:35,836
No.

575
00:50:36,753 --> 00:50:39,423
This is the protocol, you know.

576
00:50:40,215 --> 00:50:43,218
I'm just following protocol.

577
00:50:43,302 --> 00:50:44,344
Seriously.

578
00:51:04,364 --> 00:51:05,824
Commander.

579
00:51:05,908 --> 00:51:06,909
Yeah?

580
00:51:10,621 --> 00:51:11,788
The truth is…

581
00:51:19,254 --> 00:51:20,505
The truth is,

582
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:24,468
I came here to create embryos
using the MZ Group heir's sperm

583
00:51:25,594 --> 00:51:27,596
and his wife's eggs.

584
00:51:28,972 --> 00:51:29,806
What?

585
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:33,060
I hid the eggs in the ice cream cup.

586
00:51:33,685 --> 00:51:35,270
They were my patients,

587
00:51:36,271 --> 00:51:38,273
and the wife desperately wants a child.

588
00:51:43,946 --> 00:51:45,614
While pretending to be a tourist…

589
00:51:48,116 --> 00:51:49,785
I managed to fertilize an egg.

590
00:51:52,496 --> 00:51:54,164
In my pocket outside

591
00:51:55,165 --> 00:51:57,042
is an embryo with 16 cells.

592
00:51:59,419 --> 00:52:01,129
A living being.

593
00:52:07,594 --> 00:52:08,971
Here he comes!

594
00:52:09,638 --> 00:52:10,639
He's here.

595
00:52:13,558 --> 00:52:14,434
Stay back, please.

596
00:52:18,522 --> 00:52:20,482
Hi. What's the current situation?

597
00:52:20,565 --> 00:52:21,566
Can we have an update?

598
00:52:21,650 --> 00:52:25,153
Can you tell us how you plan to bring back
the tourist from the space station?

599
00:52:25,237 --> 00:52:27,739
- When is the official briefing?
- Can you please tell us?

600
00:52:27,823 --> 00:52:29,658
- Tell us about your plan.
- Any updates?

601
00:52:29,741 --> 00:52:31,076
How's the tourist? Is he okay?

602
00:52:32,369 --> 00:52:33,954
- Why the silence?
- Please tell us.

603
00:52:34,037 --> 00:52:35,455
Excuse me! Here!

604
00:52:39,835 --> 00:52:41,461
Kill me if you want.

605
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,339
I deserve it.

606
00:52:57,561 --> 00:52:58,937
I wonder if Santi

607
00:53:00,063 --> 00:53:02,357
is with his wife now.

608
00:53:04,401 --> 00:53:05,736
I've lied to you…

609
00:53:08,238 --> 00:53:12,784
more than a hundred times because of this.

610
00:53:18,707 --> 00:53:21,960
It's nice, isn't it?

611
00:53:23,628 --> 00:53:24,588
What is?

612
00:53:33,638 --> 00:53:36,266
That means three people might die here.

613
00:53:40,437 --> 00:53:43,315
Did… Did you just say "people"?

614
00:53:46,193 --> 00:53:49,988
I don't even have the energy
to be mad at you right now.

615
00:53:51,865 --> 00:53:53,283
Why bother?

616
00:53:55,202 --> 00:53:57,496
It's all pointless now.

617
00:54:07,047 --> 00:54:09,966
Are you happy
that there are three of us dying?

618
00:54:13,512 --> 00:54:14,513
Yeah.

619
00:54:16,681 --> 00:54:19,017
I was worried
it might end up dying here alone.

620
00:54:20,852 --> 00:54:23,438
But we're sharing the same fate,
so that's a little better.

621
00:54:34,825 --> 00:54:36,201
Don't give up.

622
00:54:39,579 --> 00:54:43,500
They'll still send a rescue ship
even if we die.

623
00:54:44,751 --> 00:54:48,004
Maybe you can make them
take it back and implant it.

624
00:54:50,048 --> 00:54:52,217
Write a will or something.

625
00:54:59,266 --> 00:55:00,308
Eve.

626
00:55:04,855 --> 00:55:06,231
It's our dying wish.

627
00:55:07,482 --> 00:55:09,025
Maybe they'll do it.

628
00:55:20,162 --> 00:55:22,038
I hope it's born healthy.

629
00:55:50,609 --> 00:55:52,360
I'm happy even if I freeze to death.

630
00:56:11,671 --> 00:56:13,590
<i>Let's try the thing the mice couldn't do.</i>

631
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:16,968
<i>Even the mice couldn't do it,
so how can we?</i>

632
00:56:18,595 --> 00:56:19,721
<i>Before we die.</i>

633
00:57:06,017 --> 00:57:11,940
GONG RYONG'S 10TH DAY

634
00:57:29,583 --> 00:57:31,167
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

635
00:57:31,751 --> 00:57:34,462
<i>They're no longer getting oxygen.</i>

636
00:57:34,546 --> 00:57:36,339
<i>If we don't send a rescue ship today,</i>

637
00:57:37,132 --> 00:57:39,217
<i>we'll lose both the commander
and the tourist.</i>

638
00:57:39,301 --> 00:57:41,261
He's a complete idiot!

639
00:57:41,344 --> 00:57:43,597
Please get them to launch

640
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,600
the rescue ship right away.

641
00:57:46,683 --> 00:57:49,853
<i>I will never let Ryong die.</i>

642
00:57:49,936 --> 00:57:51,896
We're going to launch the Maru
toward the ILS orbit.

643
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:53,898
