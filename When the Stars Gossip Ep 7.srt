00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,467
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

3
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:52,385
<i>Coming up next,</i>

4
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,474
<i>we're showcasing one of the hottest names</i>
<i>in the news on "When the Stars Gossip."</i>

5
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,437
Hello.

6
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,981
It's <i>News Spotlight</i> day.

7
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,860
Joining us in the studio today is Eve Kim,

8
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,696
{\an8}commander of G.O-10 Expedition 3,

9
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,364
{\an8}who is about to venture into space.

10
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,075
{\an8}EVE KIM, EXPEDITION 3 COMMANDER

11
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,453
Can you tell us
how you're feeling right now?

12
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,371
I'm nervous.

13
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,999
That's only natural.
We're also very nervous.

14
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:29,506
Eve, can you tell us
how many times you've been to space?

15
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:34,886
This will be my third time.
But it's my first as commander.

16
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,225
There's a lot of public interest
in who Eve Kim actually is.

17
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:43,853
Are you married, Eve?

18
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:44,979
No, not yet.

19
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,105
I see.

20
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:51,236
The position of commander,

21
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,988
<i>as you are well aware,</i>
<i>is extremely important.</i>

22
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,740
<i>Many people…</i>

23
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:04,165
Is it okay for a woman
to be at the space station?

24
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:08,419
{\an8}Can't you just throw away
this dough mixer and buy a new one?

25
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:11,256
{\an8}Why would we throw it out?
Once it's fixed, it'll work fine.

26
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,716
{\an8}Come on, a new one doesn't cost much.

27
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,054
{\an8}The radiation there,
you know, those harmful rays.

28
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,515
{\an8}They say there's lots of that stuff there.

29
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:24,185
{\an8}Isn't that bad for a woman's body?
Would she be able to have children?

30
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:30,692
{\an8}-See, it works fine.
-Nice, it works.

31
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:35,071
{\an8}So?

32
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,698
{\an8}You startled me.

33
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:40,243
Female astronauts come back
and have babies all the time,

34
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,703
so it can't be that dangerous.

35
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,621
Not like they'd get pregnant there anyway.

36
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:46,416
So it's okay as long as
they don't get pregnant?

37
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,252
Even if they wanted
to get pregnant, they couldn't.

38
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,463
It's impossible
to have sex up there or get pregnant.

39
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,091
You can't get pregnant in space?

40
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,052
And you can't do it either?

41
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,389
-Why not?
-Why not?

42
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:03,808
Zero gravity.

43
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,353
For a man and a woman
to get into position…

44
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,650
Well, it would be awkward.

45
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,943
They'd be floating.

46
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,948
Hey, come on.

47
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:23,369
They can do it in those tiny rooms.
They'd be stuck together anyway.

48
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,830
Where there's a will,
there's a way, right?

49
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,166
Enough. That's all I know.

50
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,542
Dr. Jeon.

51
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,710
Hey.

52
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:33,922
Listen, together,
our ages add up to more than 150.

53
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,216
Okay.

54
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:41,554
To put it accurately, a penis
needs to fill with blood to become erect.

55
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:42,472
Right.

56
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,225
First, getting blood
to flow to the penis is tough.

57
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:49,103
And as the sperm makes its way to the egg,
it asks, "Hey, which way is it?"

58
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:51,022
The zero gravity confuses it.

59
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:56,569
Sounds like we should send Mr. Libido,
Byeon Kang-soe.

60
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,989
Anyway, nobody has ever had sex up there,

61
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,741
much less gotten pregnant.

62
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,410
Not even mice, which reproduce like crazy,
have had babies.

63
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,537
Ong-nyeo better go too then.

64
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,540
Up there, even Byeon Kang-soe
and Ong-nyeo couldn't get it on.

65
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:15,463
Hey, if you really want to have sex,
it doesn't matter where you are.

66
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,715
You'll find a way.

67
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:18,675
So true.

68
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:34,274
I'm counting on you.

69
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,777
Your mother is waiting for you.

70
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,244
You guys.

71
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:50,957
I'll never forget how you helped me
for as long as I live.

72
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,000
Thank you.

73
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,335
I love you guys.

74
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,215
From now on, you guys

75
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,968
are this child's aunt, uncle,

76
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:05,722
and brother.

77
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,764
Is brother okay?

78
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,182
Yeah.

79
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,936
Before the commander
comes looking for you,

80
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,688
you should hurry and go find her.

81
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,189
I will.

82
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:22,697
Go, team!

83
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,200
Aunt, uncle, and brother.

84
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,500
What have we done?

85
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:40,715
We just saw Kang-su
losing his rights yesterday.

86
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,175
Oh, my gosh!

87
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:44,886
We contributed to the creation of life.

88
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:48,431
I can't believe we did this
for the winning prize.

89
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:51,017
Yeah, I know.

90
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,647
Guy, let's return the ticket.

91
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:00,318
Our honor as astronauts
should eclipse 500 billion.

92
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:01,486
-What?
-What?

93
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,863
Don't you feel any remorse
in knowing that we just sold out?

94
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,074
For 500 billion, yeah.

95
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,158
But say we get caught,

96
00:06:07,241 --> 00:06:11,245
we could at least claim that we did it
to help the creation of a human life.

97
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,247
Not some money.

98
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:17,168
We ought to feel ashamed of ourselves
as astronauts.

99
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,670
Shame is

100
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,549
just a feeling.

101
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:25,301
Are you suggesting that

102
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:28,262
we should return the 500 billion
so we don't feel ashamed?

103
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,890
To Kang Kang-su who's swimming in money?

104
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,434
How much luck does this guy need?

105
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:38,064
Shouldn't the pride
of our privileged profession

106
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,399
outweigh some prize money?

107
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,161
Where have you been?

108
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,621
Come here, quickly.

109
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:01,003
What sound

110
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,381
did you say this was?

111
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,301
It's the male courting the female.

112
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,347
-It's pretty loud.
-I know, right?

113
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,978
Think they'll do it now?

114
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,105
What?

115
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:32,076
That's it, get on top.

116
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,203
Go on, get on top of her.

117
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,830
You can do it, come on.

118
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,123
-Hurry.
-Get on top.

119
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,250
That's it, you can do it.

120
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,711
Give it all you've got!

121
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,714
You…

122
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:53,055
The fact that they engaged in chasing
means they both want it.

123
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:56,684
So why does the female run away
when it counts?

124
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,521
Why is she dodging him?

125
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,231
Why would she run away?

126
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,347
In zero gravity,
female mice lose muscle mass

127
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,100
and bone density
at a faster rate than male mice.

128
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,771
Because the females
experience more bone loss,

129
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:46,025
I think they avoid mating
and getting pregnant because it's risky.

130
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,945
Without a harness,

131
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,864
the male didn't even attempt
to mount the female,

132
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,449
so I thought he was the problem.

133
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:55,243
So the problem lies with the female.

134
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,828
Which was unexpected.

135
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,958
Could female hormones be the solution?

136
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,001
Let's see.

137
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,881
Wow, the levels of female hormones
are much lower here than on Earth.

138
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,759
How about we inject the female
with female hormones for a bit

139
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,387
and see if her bone density decreases?

140
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,056
Okay, sounds good.

141
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,642
Thank you.

142
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,186
I know a thing or two
about female hormones.

143
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,145
You do.

144
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:28,401
Then you check the progress here,

145
00:09:28,484 --> 00:09:30,152
and I'll…

146
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,743
So, do I make a good assistant?

147
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,668
I'm going back down in two days.

148
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,882
You want me to babysit
a tourist for eight days?

149
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,092
ONE YEAR EARLIER

150
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,595
He doesn't know how to do anything.

151
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,472
I'd be surprised
if he could even find the bathroom.

152
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,725
This is my first command.

153
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:03,644
How can you ask me
to carry around deadweight?

154
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:05,688
Who is this guy anyway?

155
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,608
How much money do you have to have
to vacation in space?

156
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,192
I'm already busy as it is.

157
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,737
This is the first mission for Koreans.

158
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,531
What if he messes up?
Why are you dumping him on us?

159
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,951
I mean, come on,
why are you doing this to me?

160
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:22,997
<i>Do you have to make it so obvious</i>
<i>how much you hate this?</i>

161
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,871
DR. GONG RYONG

00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:09,126
She's suffering from hypothermia
and is in cardiac arrest.

163
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,259
MZ MEDICAL CENTER

164
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:30,689
Min-jeong.

165
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:32,733
Min-jeong, open your eyes.

166
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,611
We found this phone at the site.

167
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:40,282
The last call she received
was from Gong Ryong.

168
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,826
He called right after the accident.

169
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,044
KOREA SPACE AGENCY

170
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,182
Why did you go so far away?

171
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:07,643
I wanted coffee,
and I wanted to walk for a bit.

172
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,645
Is something wrong?

173
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,313
What would be wrong?

174
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,529
My head hurts.
It feels like it's going to explode.

175
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:25,369
Without caffeine,
I don't think I'd be able to function.

176
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,413
Whatever, you always do great.

177
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:32,585
Hang on!

178
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:33,752
Wait for me.

179
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,838
Don't run.

180
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:41,802
Damn it, last night was a failure too.

181
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,180
Last night? What was?

182
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,890
Why are you asking the obvious?

183
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:47,683
Sex.

184
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,731
Dong-a, can't you stay?

185
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,567
I thought we would have
another mission together.

186
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,943
Do you have to leave?

187
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,695
Who am I going to fight? So boring.

188
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,324
I actually didn't mind
that arrogant voice of yours.

189
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,493
What's gotten into you all?

190
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,143
That's okay, right?

191
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,359
Is everyone on the ILS asleep?

192
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:39,485
Yes.

193
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,238
What's that?

194
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:47,618
Those are 1,836 pieces
of fuel tank debris from a collision

195
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,745
with a low-orbit satellite,
and they've been

196
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:52,790
playing tag with each other
about 200 miles above the ILS.

197
00:13:52,873 --> 00:13:54,583
And there was a second collision?

198
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:58,963
Yes, so a new piece of debris,
which is about 13 cm in diameter,

199
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,799
looks like it's approaching the ILS.

200
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:02,841
What are the odds?

201
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:06,220
One in ten thousand.

202
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:07,972
So, 0.01%.

203
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,808
We can avoid it if we adjust the orbit.

204
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:11,976
How fast is it moving?

205
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,315
{\an8}The delta-v is 0.7 m per second.

206
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,859
{\an8}-Call Eve.
-Got it.

207
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,707
SEOUL MCC

208
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,671
Hello?

209
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,427
Everyone is asleep, so I'll do it myself.

210
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,323
I'll use the fuel thrusters
on the G.O cargo ship

211
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,741
to change the orbit.

212
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,424
Orbit adjustment complete.

213
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,593
Okay. Good job.

214
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:30,346
Double-check it in the morning,
just in case.

215
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,015
Go and try to get some more shut-eye.

216
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,141
<i>Copy.</i>

217
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,110
Don't let your guard down.

218
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:29,196
The network can only detect
debris larger than 10 cm.

219
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,864
It's the smaller ones we miss,

220
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:34,118
the ones like bullets,
that are the real danger.

221
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:37,204
As a matter of fact, we're worried
the smaller ones might collide

222
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:41,000
and create a cloud
of tiny debris smaller than 10 cm.

223
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,668
I'm keeping my eyes peeled.

224
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,295
Where did he go?

225
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:47,965
Who?

226
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,049
No one.

227
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,592
Stay alert.

228
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,423
GROSS HABITS DIE HARD

229
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,565
You still haven't kicked the habit?

230
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,901
Did you have breakfast?

231
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,612
Should we have breakfast?

232
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,284
EVE'S PLACE, A FEW DAYS AGO

233
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,748
Where did you put the remote, Eve?

234
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,960
<i>On October 4th, 1957,</i>

235
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:11,340
<i>the USSR launched Sputnik 1,</i>
<i>the first artificial Earth satellite.</i>

236
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,433
What are you doing here?

237
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,352
What about you?

238
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:27,189
Me? I came to turn off Eve's TV.

239
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,025
She asked me to turn it off earlier.

240
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,401
She asked you?

241
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,862
When did she ask you? It was me she asked.

242
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,114
There's no way.

243
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,990
She wouldn't ask her boss to do that.

244
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:40,577
But she'd ask an ex-coworker?
Stop talking nonsense.

245
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,412
It's hot.

246
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:44,164
What are you doing?

247
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,166
What do you mean?

248
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,587
Right. I'll be on my way.

249
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,005
You can have this.

250
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:52,923
Running away?

251
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,136
Me?

252
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,429
Didn't you come to turn off the TV?

253
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,102
Done.

254
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,604
It's like you're used to doing it.

255
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,023
In the US, 70% of people

256
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:13,026
shove the remote
between the cushion and the right armrest.

257
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,070
Did Eve also give you her passcode?

258
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,990
No, I asked Dona.

259
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,074
I see.

260
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:22,161
As for that shirt…

261
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,413
Can you either cover up or take it off?

262
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,791
This? Why?

263
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,920
You're sending me some mixed messages.

264
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,297
It's making me think twice.

265
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,757
I'll do what I want.

266
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,552
You do what you want.
Don't tell me what to do.

267
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,603
If I told you not to quit, would you stay?

268
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:50,397
No, I would quit.
I would quit, no matter what.

269
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,274
They're offering a lot of money.

270
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,943
-Exactly.
-Yes, exactly.

271
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,363
I'm going.

272
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,306
This doesn't feel right.

273
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,310
I think I confused my respect for you

274
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:30,812
for romantic feelings,
now that I'm leaving.

275
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,232
I'm really sorry.

276
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,738
Sure.

277
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,243
I get that you could be confused.

278
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,579
Since you're confused anyway,

279
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,873
how about we make this serious?

280
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,798
Please.

281
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,675
Please, God.

282
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:49,349
Take pity on this life
and turn it into a baby.

283
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,601
Please, I'm begging you.

284
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:10,120
Wait, she didn't even disinfect it once.

285
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:13,248
How can she still have
the same dressing I put on?

286
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,752
Commander.

287
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:20,714
Commander.

288
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:28,847
Seriously, I know you're busy,
but this is going too far.

289
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,684
I told you, worst-case,
you could lose your foot.

290
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,522
Every time you used the rails,
you would've rubbed it

291
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,441
until the wound got infected.

292
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,402
You're either brave or stupid.

293
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,154
I'll go blind if I look at the sun.

294
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:45,906
I'll die if I open the window.

295
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,491
If I do this or that, I'll die.

296
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:49,201
Even if I take a dump, I'll die.

297
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:54,456
You're always telling me what to do,
so why can't you take care of yourself?

298
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,876
I swear…

299
00:22:58,794 --> 00:22:59,961
Commander.

300
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,048
Wake up.

301
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,636
Damn it.

302
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:51,721
She wouldn't even know
if someone carried her out of here.

303
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,520
<i>This is the first mission for Koreans.</i>

304
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:01,314
What if he messes up?
Why are you dumping him on us?

305
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:05,360
I mean, come on,
why are you doing this to me?

306
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:08,405
Do you have to make it so obvious
how much you hate this?

307
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:10,157
He's coming to say hi today.

308
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,495
Chief.

309
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,582
Come on, it's my first time as commander.

310
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:22,419
Why should I have to babysit a tourist?

311
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,881
He won't even know how
to eat, sleep, shit, or bathe himself.

312
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,466
I'll have to chase after him
and help him wipe his butt.

313
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,594
How is it any different than a newborn?

314
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,846
Forget it.

315
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:35,557
I'm not taking any tourists.

316
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,642
I don't want to do it.
Take back the order.

317
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,481
You're here. Eve.

318
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,782
Say hi. This is your commander, Eve Kim.

319
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,244
Hello.

320
00:25:07,505 --> 00:25:09,007
You don't have to babysit me.

321
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,593
I won't cause any trouble.

322
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:22,771
You did babysit me.

323
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,483
All I did was cause trouble.

324
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,750
When we're back on Earth
and standing on solid ground,

325
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:49,506
let's go out for meals,

326
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,259
movies and walks, just like everyone else.

327
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,845
If it rains, let's get wet,

328
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:58,682
and let the wind blow us over.

329
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,396
Let's go on dates like they do on Earth.

330
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,150
When we get back, I'll be good to you.

331
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,861
Once I set foot on solid ground,

332
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,283
I can be good to you too.

333
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,720
<i>Whenever I want to see you,</i>

334
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,142
<i>I hope it's someplace</i>
<i>where you're only a cab ride away.</i>

335
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,448
Why do we have to
bring it back to him personally?

336
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:00,160
Just put it back in the storage module

337
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:01,745
where I first found it!

338
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:02,787
We can do that, right?

339
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:05,081
That's all we have to do!

340
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,458
Do you really think

341
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,712
that Kang Kang-su is gonna find it
in the next two days

342
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,505
before going back to Earth?

343
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,175
No way. It'd be like throwing it away.

344
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,885
You wanna throw away 500 billion?

345
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,595
I don't care if he finds it or not.

346
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:20,597
Guys.

347
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,808
If we don't do this right,
we'll regret it.

348
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,770
And if we don't do this now,
say we sleep on it,

349
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,646
we might change our minds.

350
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,523
And we'll regret that.

351
00:27:30,607 --> 00:27:32,692
And if we leave it
in the storage module like you say,

352
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,819
we'll want to check, we'll be tempted.

353
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:38,865
And we'll think things like,
"What if we took it?"

354
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,658
"What if the ticket goes to waste?"

355
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,494
"What if?" "Why didn't we just steal it?"

356
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,037
And then we're back to square one.

357
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,247
Except as thieves who stole nothing!

358
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,750
What about our pride? Our dignity?

359
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:53,630
Do you really wanna live with that level
of regret for the rest of your lives?

360
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,967
Just do it and get it over with!

361
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,480
Wait.

362
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,279
I'm sorry.

363
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,989
I was

364
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,200
in a rush.

365
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,211
Let's reconsider this, Santi.

366
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,879
Just hurry up!

367
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:51,271
Why does God lead us into temptation?

368
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,107
You really wanna stay here all night?

369
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,567
We might wake him up!

370
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,101
What the hell?

371
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,383
Hello.

372
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,011
Doctor. Go-eun.

373
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,636
DR. GONG RYONG

374
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,650
It's Gong Ryong. What should I do?

375
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,154
Should I answer it?

376
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:48,907
Min-jeong.

377
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:52,493
Wake up and answer Gong Ryong's call.

378
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,709
Turn it off!

379
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,378
I don't care if it's Ryong or Kang-su.

380
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:05,340
Don't ever let those two bastards
call my family again.

381
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,508
Understood?

382
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,845
Oops!

383
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,222
<i>Why is it so hard to get through to you?</i>

384
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,558
<i>I've been on the edge of my seat waiting.</i>

385
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,644
<i>It worked.</i>

386
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:19,771
I did it without a microscope.

387
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:21,564
I performed an ICSI manually

388
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:23,274
and fertilized the last remaining egg.

389
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,156
Are you listening?

390
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:34,035
<i>Are you too happy to say anything?</i>

391
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,788
<i>Is it because you can't believe it?</i>

392
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,456
<i>It's the truth.</i>

393
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:42,168
<i>It needs two more days in the incubator</i>

394
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,878
<i>to become a morula.</i>

395
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:48,466
I'm going to do whatever it takes
to bring you a morula.

396
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,802
<i>You have to stay strong.</i>

397
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:54,138
<i>Soon, it'll be your turn to take over.</i>

398
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,308
<i>I'm going to make sure</i>

399
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,311
<i>you hear the word "Mom,"</i>
<i>just like you've always wanted.</i>

400
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,396
<i>Okay?</i>

401
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,440
Give it to me.

402
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:07,276
I think I hear someone.
I'll call you back.

403
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,237
Ryong!

404
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,289
Min-jeong?

405
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,083
Min-jeong!

406
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:26,921
She's coming to.

407
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,308
You're lying.

408
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,019
If you tell Eve,

409
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,562
I'll kill you.

410
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:45,231
Even you wouldn't stoop that low.

411
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,401
I trust you won't.

412
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:05,460
Blood pressure, pulse, body temperature,
and PLR are all normal.

413
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:11,132
Sweetie, are you conscious?

414
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,342
Did you hear him?

415
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,553
We can finally breathe easy.

416
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:18,723
Min-jeong, our family has been saved!

417
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:23,061
Min-jeong, can you see me?

418
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,145
Do you see me?

419
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,566
You heard what Ryong just said, right?

420
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:32,028
He made my grandchild.
You heard it too, didn't you?

421
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,032
Ryong saved our family.

422
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,326
Ryong saved us.

423
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,850
There's no way.

424
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:24,205
Hello.

425
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,128
Have something to eat.

426
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:32,880
Here you go.

427
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,257
Gracias.

428
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,554
After eating,
you should get some sleep, Commander.

429
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,972
Didn't you work all night?

430
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:44,016
-No, it's okay.
-You probably didn't sleep much.

431
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,435
We should be clear of the debris now,

432
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,396
so I'll handle the rest with MCC.

433
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:51,315
After you're done eating,
go get some shut-eye.

434
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,483
She slept well.

435
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,194
How would you know?

436
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:57,780
Once I'm asleep, someone could
carry me out and I wouldn't know.

437
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:02,285
It's probably because
I'm a bit slow and brave too.

438
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,205
Everyone knows how brave you are.

439
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,748
Why would you get rained on?

440
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,211
Rain? Where did that come from?

441
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,921
I don't like getting rained on.

442
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,717
If there's one thing
I hate more than rain, it's wind.

443
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,012
Someone here has a really loud voice.

444
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:26,434
Hey, it doesn't make sense.
How did you do it alone?

445
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,810
You're a fraud, aren't you?

446
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:29,520
It's impossible to do manually.

447
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,607
-Jealous?
-What?

448
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,067
-Are you jealous?
-Listen, you bastard.

449
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,986
Dr. Kang, what are you doing?

450
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,863
Why would I be jealous of a loser?

451
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,072
Dr. Kang, stop it.

452
00:36:40,156 --> 00:36:42,325
There must be
some sort of misunderstanding.

453
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:45,995
Your life isn't even worth
comparing to mine.

454
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,331
Just with your hands? No way.

455
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:51,459
-Dr. Kang!
-Hey!

456
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,627
Dr. Kang.

457
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:59,842
{\an8}GONG RYONG'S 7TH DAY

458
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,031
So were there more collisions?

459
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:23,991
How big is this one?

460
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,702
-Even though we adjusted the orbit?
-Yes, even after that.

461
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,956
It looks like the size of the debris cloud
is larger than we calculated.

462
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:32,875
We're seeing debris smaller than 10 cm
undetectable by radar,

463
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,253
spread out widely
into where we adjusted our orbit.

464
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:40,633
Then, is there a possibility
they could all return to Earth?

465
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:53,437
<i>Informing the ILS.</i>
<i>Code yellow, code yellow.</i>

466
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,232
<i>This message is</i>
<i>for all crew aboard the ILS.</i>

467
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:59,068
<i>As of 20:03,</i>
<i>we are initiating a code yellow.</i>

468
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:03,239
<i>The 1,836 pieces of space debris</i>
<i>we've been tracking since last night</i>

469
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:05,658
<i>have collided in succession,</i>
<i>forming a debris cloud.</i>

470
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,576
It isn't serious, is it?

471
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,954
This happens three or four times a year.

472
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,998
In a case like this,

473
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,792
we get into the Scorpion and wait.

474
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,670
Worst-case,
we evacuate immediately in the Scorpion.

475
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,839
Mr. Gong, pack all
your essential belongings.

476
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,800
Are you saying
we could go back to Earth today?

477
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,553
It's just a precaution, just in case.

478
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,139
It's never happened in my experience.

479
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,932
<i>It's too late to adjust again.</i>

480
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,893
<i>We think the space debris</i>
<i>will pass through in 40 minutes.</i>

481
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,687
<i>Prepare to evacuate if necessary.</i>

482
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:38,232
{\an8}<i>Pack only the essentials</i>
<i>and wait in the Crew Scorpion.</i>

483
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,901
{\an8}<i>This is nothing new.</i>
<i>Just do as you were trained.</i>

484
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:44,113
<i>Let's pray the debris cloud</i>
<i>clears the station.</i>

485
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,740
<i>Oh, and Kang Kang-su.</i>

486
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,909
<i>Given the emergency, I'm putting</i>
<i>your disciplinary action on hold.</i>

487
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,703
Go with the other astronauts.

488
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,290
Dr. Kang, load the fruit flies
onto the cargo ship.

489
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:55,791
And Mina,

490
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,169
move the lettuce you grew to the freezer.

491
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,837
-Okay.
-Santi.

492
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,132
Load the frozen human biosamples
on the CTV, okay?

493
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,467
Aye, Captain.

494
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,886
{\an8}Okay, Dr. Lee, let's go get the mice.

495
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:10,890
{\an8}If things go south,
the CTV will leave for Earth first.

496
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,767
Okay, let's get a move on.

497
00:39:13,809 --> 00:39:16,479
Mr. Tourist, collect your personal items,

498
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:19,106
go to the Scorpion, and stay put.

499
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:24,779
Okay.

500
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:55,017
Come here.

501
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:03,234
All right, come here.

502
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:05,444
Come on, let's go.

503
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:06,737
You finish up here.

504
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:07,863
Okay.

505
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:40,563
Is it a morula yet?

506
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,108
How long has it been?

507
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:49,363
Not yet.

508
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,865
Forget it.

509
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,033
Go and wait in the Scorpion.

510
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,828
Stop wasting time.
You're putting yourself at risk. Come on.

511
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,998
Is there a hidden spot
to plug this in on the Scorpion?

512
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,002
It has to develop into a morula.

513
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,045
Is there somewhere to plug it in or not?

514
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:08,507
There's no way

515
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,719
I'm going back empty-handed.

516
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,679
Nothing ever comes of this.

517
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,890
Do as you were told
and wait in the Scorpion.

518
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,851
And what if it really leaves?

519
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:22,396
What if it leaves and I've abandoned this
because I chose to save myself?

520
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:26,775
I'm taking this with me no matter what.
And if it leaves, we leave together.

521
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,863
And if it ends in standby mode,
we come here and plug it back in.

522
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:36,952
Is there a place to plug this in?

523
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:41,832
Without power, it won't develop
into a morula and will die. You know that.

524
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,877
Is there or isn't there?

525
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,299
There isn't?

526
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,263
I'll find a place to hide it
and plug it in.

527
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,681
But get it to me ASAP.

528
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,810
It'll be fine as long as Eve doesn't know.

529
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:03,854
Just Eve?

530
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,241
You guys are unbelievable.

531
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:21,830
It's important you make sure
there's only one male per cage.

532
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:25,501
This damn space debris.
I should've known things were too quiet.

533
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,504
The mouse cage has 30% capacity remaining.

534
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:30,923
We need to hurry.

535
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:33,634
Dr. Kang, how much do you have left to do?

536
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:37,012
There are a lot of fruit flies.
It's going to take some time.

537
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,975
I'm only going to load
the Japanese greens and the romaine.

538
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:44,645
Okay, then I'll head to the Scorpion
and put it on standby.

539
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,730
As soon as you're done here, get on board.

540
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,693
-Santi, hurry up!
-Yes.

541
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:58,409
I'm going to go and pack my stuff.

542
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,625
Dr. Kang, did you pack
all the important stuff?

543
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,712
Important? Like what?

544
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:16,468
The expensive stuff.

545
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:22,725
Thanks to my colleagues,
any love I had for this place is gone,

546
00:43:22,808 --> 00:43:24,059
and I'm being disciplined.

547
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,939
Don't worry,
I packed everything worth anything.

548
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,190
So mind your own business.

549
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,655
What did he say?

550
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:37,990
Does he have the ticket?

551
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,451
He does for sure.

552
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,747
Five hundred billion
just rained down upon him,

553
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,707
and that bastard plays it cool.

554
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:48,542
Yeah.

555
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,502
Must be nice.

556
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:51,879
Let's go.

557
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:57,635
<i>You have 20 minutes until impact.</i>
<i>Calmly board the Scorpion and wait there.</i>

558
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,511
<i>Please follow the training manual.</i>

559
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:04,767
Shit.

560
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,318
Damn it.

561
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:14,711
This is Scorpion.
The life support system is all clear.

562
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,672
The Scorpion's engine is nominal.

563
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:18,757
Okay.

564
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:25,264
We're not really
going back to Earth today, are we?

565
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,059
Dr. Kang,
I'm sure you'd be happy to go back.

566
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:43,991
<i>Eve, is the entire crew on standby?</i>

567
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:47,828
What's keeping you, Dr. Gong?

568
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:51,790
On my way.

569
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,876
<i>Where are you? Why aren't you on board?</i>

570
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,085
I'm on my way, Eve.

571
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:12,603
Look at this!

572
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:19,568
Code red, code red.

573
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,529
The debris will hit earlier than expected.

574
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:24,323
Santi.

575
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:26,200
-Get ready to depart.
-I'm on it.

576
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,784
I'll go get the tourist.

577
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:30,162
No, I'll go get the tourist.

578
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,462
What was that?

579
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,857
Oh, shit.

580
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,313
What was that?

581
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:40,857
What's going on?

582
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,153
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

583
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:49,491
<i>Debris has taken</i>
<i>the storage module antenna out.</i>

584
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:52,661
<i>The Wi-Fi and radio comms</i>
<i>in the observation module are down.</i>

585
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,955
This is IOU,

586
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:58,917
checking to see if we can restore comms
to the observation module. Over.

587
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:02,629
This is Seoul. The debris cloud
is expected to pass through the station.

588
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,048
<i>It is projected to pass</i>
<i>within one mile of the station.</i>

589
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,634
<i>Terminate standby.</i>
<i>Scorpion, switch to departure mode.</i>

590
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,845
Scorpion, switch to departure mode.

591
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,513
<i>Is everyone aboard?</i>

592
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,765
The tourist has not yet boarded.

593
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:18,687
Eve?

594
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:22,858
Fuck, what's going on?

595
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:25,611
Hey! Commander!

596
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:28,113
Has anyone here seen the tourist?

597
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:29,698
I'll go get him.

598
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,491
I saw him in the observation module.

599
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,201
In the observation module?

600
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:37,414
But that's in the opposite direction.
You saw him there?

601
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,625
I'll go get him.

602
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,168
No, I'll go, Commander.

603
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,586
Chief.

604
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:44,880
IOU says a breach has been detected
in the storage module,

605
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:46,298
and both hatches have been sealed.

606
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,468
That means
the storage module has zero oxygen.

607
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:51,595
You must not open those hatches.

608
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:54,181
<i>There is no way</i>
<i>in or out of the observation module.</i>

609
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:59,603
When did you see him in there?

610
00:49:00,687 --> 00:49:01,980
Check the CCTV.

611
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:12,407
-There.
-I see him…

612
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,576
He's leaving the main module.

613
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,497
But I don't see him returning.
He's still in the observation module.

614
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:21,667
The tourist is trapped
in the observation module alone?

615
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,043
Oh, no.

616
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:35,889
I'm here.

617
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,519
I'm in here.

618
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:44,022
I said, I'm in here!

619
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:01,915
I'm going out.

620
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:05,627
It's pointless.

621
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,838
We can't reach the area
with the tourist anyway.

622
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:11,633
If we have people stuck in two areas,
it'll only complicate the rescue.

623
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,760
I'll go out and spacewalk over.

624
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,804
<i>Spacewalk? You're going to go out there?</i>

625
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,347
Are you out of your mind?

626
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,766
We have no idea
when the rescue ship will come.

627
00:50:20,392 --> 00:50:21,893
Something could happen.

628
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,730
I have to go out there and bring Mr. Gong.

629
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,982
I am not leaving him here alone.

630
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:39,870
Headset.

631
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:42,038
If I go over there,

632
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:44,374
we can use a G.O ship
to get back to Earth.

633
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,086
I'm going to get him
and take him back down.

634
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,631
<i>Are you crazy? As commander,</i>
<i>you need to think rationally.</i>

635
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:52,883
You're being reckless!

636
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,217
Chief!

637
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,386
If they don't leave now,
they'll be in danger.

638
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,055
This is an order.

639
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:02,058
We'll send a rescue ship for the tourist.
Leave this instant.

640
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:04,060
Close the hatch right now!

641
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:31,421
Han Si-won, activate
the remote emergency separation.

642
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:33,381
We'll close the hatch from here.

643
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:41,348
Chief, please,
at least let me stay behind.

644
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,521
Han Si-won.

645
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:55,654
Damn it.

646
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,505
Chief!

647
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:58,550
Remote emergency separation
has been activated.

648
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,511
All six hooks have been released.

649
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:03,513
Departure is imminent.

650
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,529
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

651
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:20,780
Damn it.

652
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,200
Damn it!

653
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,249
Eve.

654
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:42,344
Commander?

655
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,013
Commander, Eve.

656
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,098
Santi.

657
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,434
Dr. Mina, Dr. Lee, can you hear me?

658
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:53,229
Hey, Kang Kang-su, you son of a bitch!
I'm in here.

659
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,649
Can't anybody hear me? I'm still here!

660
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:13,333
<i>Beyond the Huangpu River…</i>

<i>Most people use clams, but…</i>

662
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:56,835
No.

663
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:58,712
I'm still here!

664
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:00,880
I'm over here!

665
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:02,924
Somebody help me!

666
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:43,131

{\an8}<i>The space tourist</i>

EPILOGUE

689
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:00,291
G.O-10 Expedition 3…

690
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,086
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi.

691
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:04,712
Hi.

692
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:07,632
-How are you?
-Fine, how are you doing?

693
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:08,883
-Good.
-Good.

694
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:12,387
-I speak Korean very well.
-Really? What a surprise.

695
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:15,765
-Me too. My Korean is good.
-Nice to meet you.

696
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,394
A little bit later,

697
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:23,314
could I get your autograph?

698
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:24,566
A little later.

699
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:29,028
-My autograph.
-I'm so nervous.

700
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:32,073
-No need to be nervous. It'll be fine.
-Right.

701
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:35,785
We're going live in three, two, one.

702
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:38,955
Many people want to know
what the position of commander entails

703
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:42,292
and exactly what kind of work you do.

704
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:44,878
It's not really different
from anything else.

705
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:50,550
My role is to ensure the safety
and well-being of the astronauts.

706
00:57:50,633 --> 00:57:53,094
Insure, as in you "insured" them?

707
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,513
What I meant was "ensure," not "insure."

708
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,348
-Oh, yes. My apologies.
-It's okay.

709
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,684
Right.

710
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:03,438
The pressure…

711
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:06,983
There's a lot of pressure…

712
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:14,657
I'm sorry.

713
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:16,618
I hope you will all keep watching

714
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:21,831
right up until the moment Eve Kim
embarks on her journey to space.

715
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:25,376
This has been Lee Hwa-sin
for <i>News Spotlight</i>.

716
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:28,087
Let's cut to commercial.

717
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:30,673
Can I have your autograph?

718
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,300
Please? Yes.

719
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:35,136
Autograph.

720
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,222
Okay.

721
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:41,559
Thank you.

722
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,020
"Kong Hyo-jin"?

723
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,649
Kong Hyo-jin? Who's Kong Hyo-jin?

724
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:50,652
Oh, no. I thought that was what you wrote.

725
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:52,278
Thank you.

726
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,947
-Thank you.
-Thanks a lot.

727
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,823
No, thank you for coming today.

728
00:58:55,907 --> 00:58:57,492
-It was nothing.
-Thanks.

729
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:58,826
Let's go.

730
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,620
-Okay.
-Okay, let's go.

731
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:01,913
Oh, don't forget this.

732
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:05,500
-Kong Hyo-jin's autograph.
-Yeah.

733
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:06,876
Thank you.
