<i>Her womb was like</i>
<i>a bottle of alcohol but comforting.</i>

319
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,804
<i>The hospital room that day</i>
<i>was shabby but warm.</i>

320
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,223
<i>Even though they reeked of cigarettes,</i>

321
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,727
<i>I felt very safe and loved by my aunties.</i>

322
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:39,459
<i>You're just biding your time</i>

323
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:45,966
<i>You're just looking from afar</i>

324
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:50,762
<i>Even though you whisper constantly</i>

325
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:52,430
<i>You can't say…</i>

326
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,683
I'm not finished. You're so impatient.

327
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,769
<i>…that you love me</i>

328
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,688
What?

329
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,273
- My foot.
- Did I step on it?

330
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,983
- Damn you.
- For God's sake.

331
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:08,655
You asshole. Hey!

332
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,408
<i>My mother died right after she had me.</i>

333
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,370
<i>The three aunties who were there that day</i>
<i>became my mothers.</i>

334
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,708
<i>They worked in a bar</i>

335
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,043
<i>to make sure I get an education.</i>

336
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,589
<i>I had to study,</i>

337
00:24:26,173 --> 00:24:29,301
<i>so somebody told them</i>
<i>to do whatever it took to make money.</i>

338
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:31,553
<i>The somebody was me.</i>

339
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,221
This is so fucking hard.

340
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,061
And who might this be?

341
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,314
Give me my tuition money.

342
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:45,358
- I don't have it.
- Hurry up and give it to me.

343
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,402
- Tomorrow, my dear.
- You reek of booze.

344
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:48,820
Oh, my back hurts.

345
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:52,824
If he had fun with my beautiful moms,
he should've paid up.

346
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,076
Which asshole is it? Is he gone?
Where did he go?

347
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,119
He ran off.

348
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,370
Where did he go?

349
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:00,957
Damn it.

350
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,752
Go straight home!

351
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,503
Let's go for one more round.

352
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:10,383
I'm here for my money.

353
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,677
Damn it.

354
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:15,805
You little shit.

355
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:18,725
Hey!

356
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:19,768
Damn it.

357
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,858
What did you pick up that rock for?

358
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:30,362
If you had a good time
with some beautiful ladies,

359
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,698
at least have a conscience.

360
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,410
And you have the money.

Good work, everyone.

Doctor! The baby isn't crying.

00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,832

Are you okay?

392
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,457
What's going on?

393
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,417
Breathe.

394
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,879
Breathe.

395
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:54,964
You have to breathe.

396
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,606
Congratulations

I AM A BIRTHING HERO

407
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:51,706

This video was just taken in our IVF lab.

415
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:14,729
{\an8}It shows one
of our specialists performing an ICSI.

416
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:19,275
It shows Mr. Choi's sperm
being injected into Ms. Na's egg.

417
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,569
As you can see,
Mr. Choi's sperm is deformed

418
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,697
and has genetic defects.

419
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,866
Is there any way…

420
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,161
to fix it?

421
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:36,751
If you're successful,

422
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:42,298
I'll give you anything you want.

Oh, my God. I can't believe this.

432
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,097
Excuse me.

433
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,308
Hello?

434
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:34,934
Excuse me?

435
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:40,231
I'm fine. As you can see, all good.

436
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,902
It's a little dark for sunglasses.

437
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:47,655
Blood…

438
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:48,865
What?

439
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:52,243
Your forehead is bleeding.

440
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,164
It's nothing.

441
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,584
I see blood every day. I'm fine.

442
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,002
I'm okay, but…

443
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,421
Can you come out here for a second?

444
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:07,842
So, you see,
this car was passed down to me.

445
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,513
I don't know what to do about this.

446
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,681
Wow, I…

447
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:21,564
Shit.

448
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,068
Wait. Stop, please.

449
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:27,820
SURGERY PREPARATION UNDERWAY

450
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,156
It appears to be an ectopic pregnancy.

451
00:32:30,239 --> 00:32:31,658
You need emergency surgery.

452
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:34,744
The egg is implanted
in your right fallopian tube,

453
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:37,288
and the left fallopian tube
is already blocked.

454
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,831
We don't have much time,

455
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,542
so we'll start the anesthesia,
then move you to surgery.

456
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,382
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

457
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,387
After surgery, can you lend me
that scalpel over there?

458
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,974
I'm not going to let Kang Kang-su
keep his parts either.

459
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:02,772
You're…

460
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,150
You know me, right?

461
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:09,696
Yes. Nice to meet you, Ms. Choi.

462
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:13,074
Actually, I think
a pair of scissors would be better.

463
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:19,330
If you're tense,
the anesthesia won't take effect.

464
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:27,630
Your forehead is bleeding again.

465
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,099
I like children.

466
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,646
I didn't even know I was pregnant.

467
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,487
Don't worry and get some sleep.

468
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,198
There's no need to be nervous.
Trust me and go to sleep.

469
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,242
Are there…

470
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,749
any trustworthy men in this world?

471
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,009
Keep my surgery a secret.

472
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:16,262
I would never talk about a patient.
You included.

473
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:19,057
If you betray me, I'll kill you.

474
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,434
After the surgery,
I'll pretend I don't even know you.

475
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:27,440
Just do me the same courtesy
after you wake up from surgery.

476
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:31,819
Repeat after me.

477
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:35,281
"I'm going to

478
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:39,410
put my trust in you

479
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,663
and go to sleep."

480
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,966
Here you go, a scalpel
and a pair of scissors.

481
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,134
Are we good now?

482
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,428
Now, can you go to sleep? Please?

483
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,387
Go to sleep.

484
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:19,951
It's okay.

485
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,411
You can trust me.

486
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,581
Don't worry.

487
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,168
I'm your doctor.

488
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:43,224
<i>She even tried to fight the anesthesia.</i>

489
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:45,893
<i>She was amazing.</i>

490
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:49,272
<i>Maybe it was because,</i>
<i>after she fell asleep,</i>

491
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:53,109
<i>she would be consumed by guilt and regret</i>
<i>that her child was no longer in the world.</i>

00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,320
<i>MZ Group.</i>

493
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,364
<i>That's how I first met the only daughter</i>

494
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,242
<i>of a chaebol family.</i>

495
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,494
- Thank you, Doctor.
- You're welcome.

496
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,294
Are you Dr. Gong?

497
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:14,714
And you are?

498
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:19,969
At least tell me what's going on
so I know what to do.

499
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:23,931
Hey! Are you guys crazy?

500
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,893
I'm just an innocent citizen.
How dare you…

501
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:35,902
Hello, doc.

502
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,114
Hello.

503
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,951
<i>Who gave you the right</i>
<i>to operate on my daughter?</i>

504
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,121
Do you even have the faintest idea

505
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,249
how valuable the genes you destroyed were?

506
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,376
<i>You ignorant doctor.</i>

507
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,882
I don't know
how valuable those genes were,

508
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:00,301
but it's wrong to lie to a woman
and do that to her.

509
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,931
<i>Now you're saying</i>
<i>even my daughter may not have kids,</i>

510
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:08,976
<i>after my son and daughter-in-law</i>
<i>failed to have children for years.</i>

511
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,772
<i>You're responsible</i>
<i>for ending our family bloodline.</i>

512
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:15,024
What? Me?

513
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,317
- Get out.
- Why?

514
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,945
Sir? Chairman Choi? Why?

515
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,197
Hang on a second!

516
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,074
Why?

517
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,163
Wait.

520
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:45,846
Yes, sir.

521
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:49,350
Hold up! Wait a second.

522
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,394
Sir,

523
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:56,440
as a doctor, I had no choice.

524
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,025
If I were faced with the same situation,

525
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:03,155
I would have to operate on your daughter.

526
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:08,744
You're fired.

527
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,040
What did you say?

528
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:14,917
<i>Fired?</i>

529
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,377
<i>No, I'm going to make sure</i>

530
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,421
<i>you never practice medicine again.</i>

531
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,715
<i>Don't worry, Chairman Choi.</i>

532
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:22,967
<i>I'll make sure he doesn't get the job.</i>

533
00:38:23,718 --> 00:38:27,263
<i>If I hire you, Dr. Gong,</i>
<i>MZ Group said they would cut off funding</i>.

534
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,265
<i>What did you do to piss him off?</i>

535
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,600
<i>Hey, man, how have you been?</i>

536
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,811
I'll do all the dirty work,
the night shifts.

537
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:34,979
Please give me a job.

538
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,522
Oh, come on. Please.

539
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:37,982
Hello?

540
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:45,239
KIM HYE-SEONG OB-GYN CLINIC

541
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,684
Should a doctor be drinking this much?

542
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:15,519
What's it to you?

543
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:18,356
I'm sorry.

544
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:21,025
Aren't we supposed to pretend
not to know each other?

545
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,151
Stop coming here.

546
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:23,486
Let me compensate you.

547
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,154
Pretend you don't know me.

548
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,489
Is there anything I can do?

549
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:27,823
Don't do anything.

550
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,534
Do you know how hard it is
to just sit by and do nothing

551
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:32,328
knowing what you're going through?

552
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:37,208
It's hard for you?

553
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,294
You're having a hard time?

554
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,882
Ever since I got fired,

555
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,552
do you know how hellish
my life has been because of you?

556
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:51,222
After getting fired,

557
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:53,724
I thought of you and your face every day.

558
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,269
All I can think about

559
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,898
is how to get back at you and your father.

560
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,109
My thoughts are consumed with revenge!

561
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,572
Get lost.

562
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,761
How is this for revenge?

563
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,639
I like you.

564
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:41,230
Shit.

565
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,699
You know what?

566
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,492
I'm not interested in women.

567
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,828
I have more important things
to worry about.

568
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:01,208
I don't know what love is.

569
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,501
Just go.

570
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:35,951
Wake up.

571
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,746
Don't just lean on any random woman.

572
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:55,471
You're not just any random woman.

573
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:57,890
Exactly.

574
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:18,536
<i>Starting then, I guess I was asking</i>
<i>to get struck by lightning.</i>

575
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:46,647
<i>I was confused.</i>
<i>Was it revenge, love, or desire?</i>

576
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,732
I love you.

577
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:51,068
<i>"Is this love?"</i>

578
00:42:58,742 --> 00:42:59,827
Let's get married.

579
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:03,247
<i>"Do I want to marry this girl?"</i>

580
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,124
<i>I wondered.</i>

581
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:10,462
<i>Go-eun was a good person.</i>
<i>She was too good for me.</i>

582
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:13,799
<i>She owned the world,</i>

583
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,177
<i>but she shared the pain in my heart.</i>

584
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,391
<i>Fine. Let's get married.</i>

585
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,227
<i>This is the kind of girl you marry.</i>

586
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,855
<i>It isn't important whether I love her.</i>

587
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,821
What was that? Lightning?

588
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,867
Holy crap.

589
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,703
- What was that?
- I'm scared.

590
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:43,871

Mr. Gong, I'm going to take you upstairs.

593
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:10,397

00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,816
Come on, pull yourself together.

595
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:19,698
Focus.

596
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,867
- Mr. Gong! Is he okay?
- Hey, are you okay?

597
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:22,868
Sir?

598
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:27,623
It's a choking sign!

599
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:28,957
Is his windpipe clogged?

600
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:30,501
Try to cough. Can you cough?

601
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:31,919
Try to breathe!

602
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:35,589
<i>If you want to live, you have to cough!</i>
<i>Try coughing!</i>

603

Do a medical check.

604

608

Check the monitor, now!

00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,352
- What's that?
- What is it?

610
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,857
Are you okay? Try breathing.

611
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,402
Cough, or you'll die!

612
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:57,486
Eve!

Eve, are you okay?

Yes, I'm fine.

There's no time for that.

00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,905
Is he unconscious?

633
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:25,657
<i>Is he unconscious?</i>

634
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:27,868

Doctor, I think we need

00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,063
and the engine thrusters are fine too.

644
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:58,524
<i>Without gravity,</i>
<i>the Heimlich won't be easy.</i>

645
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,817
<i>You need to find the right spot</i>
<i>and push upward quickly.</i>

646
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:01,735
Copy.

647
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:03,904
Slow pressure
won't create the force needed

648
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:04,947
to expel the matter.

649
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,281
Copy!

650
00:47:19,628 --> 00:47:21,171
One, two, three!

651
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,967
<i>One, two, three!</i>

652
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,760
Come on. Hurry, Eve.

653
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:30,639
<i>- One, two, three!</i>
- Come on.

654
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:32,641
One, two, three.

655
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:34,268
Okay, come on, Eve.

656
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,562
One, two, three.

657
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:39,439
Two, three!

658
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:44,695
One, two, three!

659
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:46,905
One, two, three!

660
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:11,680
One, two, three!

661
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:16,018
Yes!

662
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:17,102
She did it!

663
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:39,750
Mr. Gong.

664
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:44,171
- Mr. Gong, are you okay?
- <i>Are you okay?</i>

665
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:46,965
Lean back and hold this.

666
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:49,468
You okay?

667
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:53,305
Can you breathe okay?

668
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:57,643
How many fingers?

669
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:05,692
Can you see
how many fingers I'm holding up?

670
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:07,778
Can you see them?

671
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:19,831
What's your name?

672
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:25,754
What's my name?

673
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,555
Don't worry, you're fine now.

674
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,394
You trust me, don't you?

675
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:42,854
I'm your commander.

676
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:45,250
I contacted IOU Mission Control.

677
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,336
They said spacecraft sometimes
get struck by lightning.

678
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:49,755
But that doesn't mean

679
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:53,383
the astronauts inside are in danger.

680
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:57,763
Fine.

681
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:00,474
Ms. Choi.

682
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:05,020
You have a call from the space station.

683
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:06,396
Have they arrived already?

684
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,316
No. It hasn't even been
an hour since they launched.

685
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:10,901
It's Mr. Kang Kang-su.

686
00:51:12,819 --> 00:51:13,695
Should I ignore it?

687
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:36,343
- Done.
- Yeah, okay.

688
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:44,392
Mr. Gong, your blood pressure
and pulse are both normal.

689
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,186
And your breathing is stabilizing.

690
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:51,650
You must wear the medical belt
until you arrive at the space station.

691
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,569
Thank you, Doctor.

692
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,696
<i>Don't thank me. Thank the commander.</i>

693
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,745
Is he allowed to drink water now?

694
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:05,497
Of course.

695
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:14,631
Aren't you thirsty?

696
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:17,509
Are you angry, Commander?

697
00:52:19,344 --> 00:52:21,471
Are you mad at me for throwing up?

698
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:24,182
Why would I be?
You spent 70 billion won on this flight.

699
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,267
You are mad.

700
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:29,187
I have to go back down.

701
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:38,822
Your feet…

702
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,179
Is it past twelve in Seoul now?

703
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,599
Or is it before?

704
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,475
<i>How can you act so normal?</i>

705
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,811
Didn't we break up as enemies?

706
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:12,147
I just spoke to your father,
so I figured I'd call.

707
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:15,066
He still likes me.

708
00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:18,570
You two can be friends,
but leave me out of it.

709
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,281
If the new guy is no better than me,

710
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,451
I'm not letting you go.

711
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:26,578
<i>Hilarious, right?</i>

712
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:28,622
<i>Go ahead. Laugh.</i>

713
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:29,664
Hey!

714
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:37,964
Why the hell is my dad
still talking to Kang-su?

715
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,591
Can't we call up IOU

716
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:42,761
and get them to delete
our numbers from his phone?

717
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:45,388
Aren't we only allowed calls
from our contact list?

718
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:49,309
The thing is,
your father gave him permission.

719
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,770
Then just don't answer his calls.

720
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:54,230
What a stupid thing to say.

721
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,349
Do you miss Earth already?

722
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:33,186
After we left Earth,

723
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:36,648
I saw a dead body.

724
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,567
There was no safety tether.

725
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:43,446
It was a dead astronaut in a space suit

726
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,157
<i>just floating…</i>

727
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:48,284
What you saw out there wasn't a dead body.

728
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:49,619
{\an8}It was a SuitSat.

729
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,788
{\an8}SUIT SATELLITE
SATELLITE MADE FROM A SPACE SUIT

730
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:55,625
That was a satellite?

731
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:58,712
This is it.

732
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:02,048
That looks like it's
from the SuitSat we've been tracking.

733
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:05,593
Look, that's a fist, and that's an arm.

734
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:06,678
Put it on the screen.

735
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:14,519
Yeah, that fist and arm
are from a SuitSat.

736
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:16,438
- What?
- Yes.

737
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:18,481
How did that thing get detached?

738
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,109
<i>A space suit costs 14 billion won.</i>

739
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:24,195
Space suits that have been discarded
at the space station

740
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,906
are recycled into satellites.

741
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:31,453
<i>And you mistook that</i>
<i>for an astronaut who died on a spacewalk.</i>

742
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:33,872
<i>MCC has been tracking its orbit.</i>

743
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:37,000
<i>It's not a big deal,</i>
<i>so there was no need to tell you guys.</i>

744
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:40,128
SuitSats are equipped
with communication devices and sensors,

745
00:55:40,211 --> 00:55:41,921
which send valuable data to Earth.

746
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:46,676
<i>A tiny,</i>

747
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,138
invisible piece of cosmic debris
probably hit the arm.

748
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:53,683
It broke off and flew
into the spacecraft's orbit,

749
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,643
causing a collision.

750
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:59,147
A single arm is tiny,
so we weren't able to detect it.

751
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,191
That's the one.

752
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:04,611
Chief, that's the one.
That was the space suit I wore last.

753
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:08,490
I wore that to fix the truss
outside the space station.

754
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:11,451
Then I rewired the cables
and attached them to the new equipment,

755
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,079
and replaced the broken power regulator.

756
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:18,416
During that, my helmet started leaking
and filled up with water.

757
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,127
I thought, "This is the end,
and I never got to marry."

758
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:24,464
I remember rushing back into the airlock.

759
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:27,675
I did all that wearing that suit.

760
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,846
You no longer work here,
so what are you doing here?

761
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,725
I'm on the clock until tomorrow.

762
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:39,979
Did you really get scouted
for a lot of money?

763
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:43,483
I should be here.
It's Eve's first command.

764
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:44,526
Is that all?

765
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:46,736
- What?
- I'm sorry?

766
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:53,910
The launch is tomorrow.

767
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:56,955
How am I supposed to wait a year?

768
00:56:58,373 --> 00:56:59,874
A year is too long, Eve.

769
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,547
It'll fly by.

770
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:13,138
We just got together.
It's going to make me crazy.

771
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,016
Can't you take the position next time?

772
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:29,696
Yes.

773
00:57:32,198 --> 00:57:33,450
That's a relief.

774
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:35,452
What are you implying?

775
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:39,831
Eve deserves to date a great guy.

776
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:42,584
I totally agree.

777
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:46,754
Go up and get some rest.

778
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:49,424
You're going to wear yourself out
before you get there.

779
00:57:49,507 --> 00:57:51,176
Yeah, go up and get some sleep.

780
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:53,511
<i>The solar panels are damaged.</i>

781
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:56,139
Do you think it will affect
docking with the station?

782
00:57:56,222 --> 00:57:58,725
We adjusted the altered orbit with Santi,

783
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:01,978
and we're inspecting
the machine module for issues.

784
00:58:02,061 --> 00:58:03,021
So, we'll have to wait.

785
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,064
Were you scared?

786
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:07,066
No.

787
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,527
Quite the dramatic start as commander.

788
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,155
Can I help with anything?

789
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:16,784
No, it's okay. I'm good.

790
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:18,745
<i>Go upstairs. That's an order.</i>

791
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:21,915
Go upstairs.

792
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,378
Copy.

793
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:31,508
Don't worry. I'll hold down the fort.

794
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:56,658
Hi.

795
00:59:09,420 --> 00:59:10,755
Let's take your temperature.

796
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:21,599
Let me know if you feel sick, though
there's probably nothing left to throw up.

797
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:31,317
I'm hot.

798
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,366
36.5 degrees. Perfectly normal.

799
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:41,536
But I feel like I have a fever.

800
00:59:54,966 --> 00:59:57,302
Don't touch the window
with your hands or face.

801
00:59:57,385 --> 00:59:59,053
You could get burned.

802
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,973
The sun's a lot stronger up here.

803
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:11,149
Oh, can I take this off too?

804
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:14,569
I'll turn it off.
Try to get some shut-eye, both of you.

805
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:17,030
Okay.

806
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,868
NO SIGNAL

807
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,787
Your foot is bleeding again.

808
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,873
You also hurt your foot? Let me see.

809
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:29,459
It looks fine.

810
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:30,460
No, your foot.

811
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:44,974
Stop moving around and rest.

812
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:57,528
Three…

813
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:03,534
Just a sec…

814
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,131
Okay, nice.

815
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:26,432
- I got it.
- Hold on.

816
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:30,853
The cut is more than a centimeter deep.

817
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,814
A Band-Aid won't stop
the bleeding for long.

818
01:01:32,897 --> 01:01:35,608
We're completely helpless
without the rails in zero gravity.

819
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,403
It's serious.
Just putting pressure on it won't cut it.

820
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:40,988
You need surgery.
It'll bleed whenever you use the rails.

821
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:43,408
Who's going to operate? You?

822
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,159
- Yes, Commander.
- Here?

823
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:49,080
- I'm a doctor.
- You <i>were</i> a doctor.

824
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:54,502
Good thing I brought
my operating tools and some sutures.

825
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:09,392
How can you possibly steady yourself

826
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:12,437
and properly
thread a needle in zero gravity?

827
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:16,691
I've threaded a billion surgical needles.

828
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:18,735
You're not going to sew it all crooked,

829
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,737
or sew my big toe
to my index toe, are you?

830
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,489
Like I said, it'll keep bleeding
when you use the rails.

831
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,367
If you keep this up,
you might end up losing both big toes.

832
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:29,370
Without them, you won't be able to walk
when we get back to Earth.

833
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:34,375
I'm being serious.

834
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:39,505
I know.

835
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:42,717
I wasn't waiting for you to answer.

836
01:02:43,634 --> 01:02:45,678
If I sew it all crooked

837
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,805
and stitch your toes together,

838
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:51,893
I will piggyback you around
for the rest of my life.

839
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:54,937
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Exactly.

840
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:57,190
That will never happen.

841
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:03,196
Before coming here,
I completed all the required training.

842
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:05,865
This isn't even surgery.

843
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,825
This gash

844
01:03:07,909 --> 01:03:10,369
just needs some anesthesia and stitches.

845
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:17,126
Okay, here I go threading the needle
for the billion and first time.

846
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:33,017
Damn it.

847
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:43,152
The blood must have rushed to my head.
My hands are swollen.

848
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,123
I've got all day.

849
01:03:57,416 --> 01:04:02,004
Here, it's a new day
every 90 minutes, right?

850
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:04,549
Within the 90 minutes
it will take to orbit the Earth,

851
01:04:04,632 --> 01:04:06,843
I promise to get it done.

852
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:08,970
Hang on.

853
01:04:26,988 --> 01:04:30,616
If I knew how to sew,
I'd stitch your mouth shut.

854
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:31,784
Those are scary words--

855
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,370
You throw up,
you're all talk, and you're full of crap.

856
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:37,373
You said it was normal
for first-timers in zero gravity.

857
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:40,209
Didn't you also feel sick your first time?
Yes or no?

858
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,545
Did you or didn't you puke?

859
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:46,173
Okay. You have nine minutes.

860
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:48,801
It won't take nine minutes.
Ninety seconds will suffice.

861
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:51,220
Once I numb the area,
stitching is a piece of cake.

862
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:59,896
Why isn't there a syringe?

863
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,982
It must have fallen out earlier.

864
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:08,362
You know, in the collision earlier.

865
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:11,616
Just do it.

866
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:14,201
No way. Do you know
how painful stitching without--

867
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:15,286
Hurry up and do it--

868
01:05:15,369 --> 01:05:18,122
No! I can find the syringe, okay?

869
01:05:18,205 --> 01:05:21,709
I know I brought it.
It can't have disappeared.

870
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:23,419
It's in here for sure.

871
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:27,048
Things lost in here
don't drop to the floor,

872
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:28,716
so they're hard to find.

873
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:31,093
It's nothing. I can handle it.

874
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:33,596
It's only a few stitches.
Let's just get it done.

875
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,308
Then, do you want to give it a shot?

876
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:39,810
I'll be quick.

877
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:41,312
Okay, let's do it.

878
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:42,521
Okay.

879
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:43,814
Okay…

880
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:51,697
Here we go.

881
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:55,785
Here goes.

882
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:58,454
Go ahead.

883
01:06:05,962 --> 01:06:07,046
But it's going to hurt.

884
01:06:10,424 --> 01:06:14,053
After I finished my last mission
and was returning to Earth,

885
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,097
I fell into
a remote area of Southeast Asia.

886
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:20,351
I crashed into a thorny bush
in the jungle at full speed,

887
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:22,687
and I didn't even flinch.

888
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:26,440
There must have been
tens of thousands of thorns in that bush.

889
01:06:27,233 --> 01:06:28,943
So don't worry, all right?

890
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:29,986
Okay.

891
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:32,029
Here goes.

892
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:38,744
Turn your head.

893
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,162
This doesn't scare me.

894
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,373
Come on, don't look!

895
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:43,666
Just leave that to me.

896
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:45,334
Thorns just prick you.

897
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:49,005
It's not the same
as sewing flesh with a needle and thread.

898
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:50,673
- Shall I do it?
- No.

899
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:52,425
- I'll do it.
- No, I'll do it.

900
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:01,726
Okay…

901
01:07:05,438 --> 01:07:06,439
Do it?

902
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:29,295
I'm almost done. Just a bit more.

903
01:07:31,797 --> 01:07:33,799
What happened to his toe?

904
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:36,677
How did he manage
to get a hole only where his big toe is?

905
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:39,430
Tell me when Ryong is on.

906
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:41,849
Okay.

907
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:47,480
<i>As planned, they will attempt</i>
<i>to dock on the morning of the 6th.</i>

908
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:51,067
<i>The process will take about three hours</i>
<i>from start to finish,</i>

909
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:54,361
<i>after which, the hatch will open</i>
<i>and they will board the space station.</i>

910
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:58,407
<i>If docking is successful,</i>
<i>Mr. Gong will move to the space station</i>

911
01:07:58,491 --> 01:08:00,743
<i>and spend the next eight days</i>
<i>on various tasks.</i>

912
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:04,371
<i>Sometime tomorrow morning, Korea time,</i>

913
01:08:04,455 --> 01:08:07,166
<i>Mr. Gong is scheduled</i>
<i>to contact IOU Mission Control.</i>

914
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:22,515
I love you.

915
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:30,564
Go-eun, I'm going to spend my life
being devoted to you.

916
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:33,943
We're going to live a fantastic life.

917
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:37,530
I promise to be faithful to you.
I'm never going to betray you.

918
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,951
Why can't you just say it back?

919
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,912
"Why can't you just say it back?"

920
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:48,749
I love you.

921
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:49,959
<i>I love you.</i>

922
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:51,961
Hello, Ms. Choi.

923
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,305
All done. You're doing well.

924
01:09:04,765 --> 01:09:06,392
Didn't you say you were done?

925
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,727
You're doing great.
I really am almost done.

926
01:09:09,937 --> 01:09:11,105
Just about done now.

927
01:09:11,188 --> 01:09:12,356
Hey, don't move.

928
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:14,358
- Almost there.
- I can't take it anymore.

929
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:19,155
- That's enough.
- No, wait.

930
01:09:19,238 --> 01:09:21,574
- I swear, I'm almost done.
- You can stop now.

931
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:22,616
- A bit more.
- No.

932
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,994
- Aren't you finished?
- Last one…

933
01:09:25,077 --> 01:09:26,328
Hey, you said you were done.

934
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:28,497
I want to make sure there's no scarring.

935
01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:30,541
- Okay.
- It looks done.

936
01:09:30,624 --> 01:09:32,418
Doesn't it, Dr. Gong?

937
01:09:37,464 --> 01:09:40,134
I swear, just one more stitch.

938
01:09:40,217 --> 01:09:42,678
Really…

939
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:44,722
Done.

940
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:46,056
Finished!

941
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:58,402
Good job.

942
01:10:26,513 --> 01:10:27,723
Thank you.

943
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:30,267
Sure.

944
01:10:31,810 --> 01:10:34,104
Get some rest. I'm going to head down.

945
01:10:38,984 --> 01:10:40,110
Commander.

946
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:44,198
your

947
01:10:45,449 --> 01:10:46,450
big toes…

948
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:49,370
are amazing.

949
01:11:20,901 --> 01:11:22,194
Your big toes…

950
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:28,367
are beautiful,

951
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:30,786
Commander.

952
01:11:58,355 --> 01:12:00,399
{\an8}SPECIAL THANKS
TO CHO JUNG-SEOK, PARK JIN-JOO

953
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:17,708
WHEN THE STARS GOSSIP

954
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:20,085
{\an8}<i>Finally, the space station.</i>

955
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:22,713
{\an8}Why is our Ryong
the only one flailing like that?

956
01:12:22,796 --> 01:12:24,173
{\an8}What is this?

957
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:26,467
{\an8}Hello.

958
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,469
{\an8}<i>They say he's just after her money.</i>

959
01:12:28,552 --> 01:12:31,555
{\an8}He's pretending to be in love with her
and even came to space for it.

960
01:12:31,638 --> 01:12:33,807
{\an8}If I succeed…

961
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:35,726
{\an8}<i>I told you, I'll do anything.</i>

962
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:36,643
{\an8}Hey.

963
01:12:37,227 --> 01:12:38,354
{\an8}Give it up.

964
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:39,772
{\an8}<i>Go-eun is mine.</i>

965
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:42,191
{\an8}<i>I'm looking for it.</i>
<i>Don't worry, I'll find it.</i>

966
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:43,317
{\an8}<i>His heart rate is dropping.</i>

967
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:44,610
{\an8}<i>What are you doing?</i>

968
01:12:44,693 --> 01:12:45,861
{\an8}<i>Did you get caught?</i>

969

Hi.

972
01:13:32,449 --> 01:13:34,618
"PLEASE FAST BEFORE DEPARTURE"

973
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:36,870
AS GONG RYONG BIT THE APPLE,
HE RECALLED EVE'S WORDS

974
01:13:36,954 --> 01:13:38,872
"WHATEVER, I DON'T EVEN LISTEN
TO MY MOTHERS"

975
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:40,958
THE APPLE WAS HEAVY LIKE EVE'S WARNING

976
01:13:41,041 --> 01:13:42,960
GONG RYONG ROLLED DOWN
THE CAR WINDOW

977
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:51,218
{\an8}"WHAT COULD GO WRONG?"

978
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:56,056
{\an8}A SLICE OF APPLE, EVE'S WARNING…

979
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:59,601
{\an8}GONG RYONG SWALLOWED THE APPLE,
THE WARNING, AND HIS DOUBTS

980
01:13:59,685 --> 01:14:01,687
{\an8}AS HE HEADED FOR THE LAUNCHPAD
